// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-27 - RX FM HOLD manual recovery restored. A continuous 2 s trigger release clears the separation latch, moves FM_ACTIVE/FM_HOLD to FM_ARMED and restores cap 255 while the deadman already holds the motor at zero. The TX keeps the selected mode declared, but the next autonomous engagement requires a fresh separation proof. Any squeeze before 2 s resets the timer. This restores the deterministic offshore escape deleted by efc39f7 without restoring the TX's old release-disarm timer. No config/packet/struct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-26 - Separation-latch stationary-near reset: a set latch is cleared when fresh/plausible TX+RX positions show radial distance below the effective D_engage and the filtered foiler speed stays below 2 km/h for 2 s. D_engage is the configured fm_engage_dist_m or the existing auto calculation, with the same 8 m floor. The check is trigger-independent, uses radial distance because rider course is unreliable at rest, and only removes eligibility. F4's immediate physical front-loss reset remains. [2026-08-27: the restored throttle-release recovery also clears the proof and changes HOLD to manual ARMED after 2 s released.] No config/packet/struct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-26 - FM rider-override semantics changed. Releasing the trigger remains the immediate deadman stop and initially parks an engaged FM in HOLD without clearing its separation/front proof; a continuous release now hands control back after 2 s as documented above. The TX keeps declaring the selected FM mode until an explicit disarm, RTM preemption, pre-throttle arm-window expiry, fault or declaration loss. Manual steering outside kFmManualSteerDeadband now wins at PWM cadence without steer-cancelling FM or clearing the latch; centring hands steering back to FM, and the divergence proof is parked during the deliberate manual deflection. Genuine GPS/link/heading/divergence faults and F4's actual loss of its proven front corridor remain safety stops. No config/packet/struct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-26 - F4 now accepts boogie_vmax_in_followme_kmh=0 with the same documented meaning as the other Follow-Me modes: no absolute vehicle-speed ceiling. The signed front-gap governor remains active and still targets rider speed +/- the existing closing margin; only the final absolute clamp is skipped. Front proof and safety gates are unchanged. No config/packet/struct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-25 - F4 IN FRONT added as a forward-pacer Follow-Me geometry. It reuses the existing min_dist + smoothing-band station, fm_engage_dist separation dwell, zone-angle Schmitt corridor, speed floor, deadman/fault/HOLD state machine, 6x divergence ceiling, steering controller and subtract-only throttle chain. F4 cannot autonomously overtake: engagement requires the buggy already >D_engage ahead along the rider's live course for 2 s and inside the front cone. The steering target is always kept ahead of the buggy; excess lead is corrected only by a finite speed cap. Loss of the proven front position hard-stops into HOLD, clears the latch and requires a fresh proof. [2026-08-26: the original zero-vmax refusal is superseded; zero now means no absolute ceiling.] No new packet, config field or confStruct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-25 - RX FM HOLD manual-recovery delay reduced 10 -> 2 s. [REMOVED 2026-08-26; RESTORED 2026-08-27 after the missing HOLD escape was identified.] Compile-time timing change only; no confStruct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-25 - RX RTM/FM D-term wrap fix. heading_error itself was normalized to +/-180 deg, but the derivative subtracted two normalized samples directly. Crossing the branch cut (for example +179 -> -179) therefore looked like a -358 deg step instead of the physical +2 deg change and Kd could saturate steering for one control tick. Normalize the same-source error delta to +/-180 before dividing by dt; source-switch/re-snap suppression, P term, gains, logging and config stay unchanged. No confStruct change; SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - THREE FOLLOW-UPS TO THE PASS BELOW, ALL OF THEM NOTIFICATION, NONE OF THEM CONTROL. (1) THE DEGRADATION NOTICE COULD BE LOST ENTIRELY, NOT MERELY DEFERRED. headingDisagreeAnnounceDegraded() rightly returns without setting its one-shot flag while thr_received >= 25 — four Serial lines upstream of a hard stop would break the motor-to-zero-first rule — but its ONLY call site was inside the if (disagree_now) branch, so the retry needed another MEASURED disagreement. A measurement needs a live COG plus a compass snapshot younger than kHeadingCompareSnapMs, and that snapshot only refreshes while the trigger is released, so a dwell that completed inside the ~1 s window after a squeeze was silenced — and a rider who then finished the session under power and never coasted above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh again rode the WHOLE SESSION with the compass withdrawn and Follow-Me refusing to engage, announced nowhere but a manual ?diag. getRtmHeading() now offers the notice on EVERY tick while the verdict stands, so the retry no longer depends on the evidence coming back; the deferral guard itself is untouched, and the print still cannot land between a proven fault and a motor-stopping write, because it can only fire below 25 counts where the deadman already holds the motor at 0. (2) A FAULT PROVEN WHILE COASTING NOW REACHES THE REMOTE. fm_fault_alarm_ms was set only if (thr_held), but the heading-disagree latch can only complete with the trigger RELEASED — so for this one fault the sticky fm_flags bit 3 never rose, the TX never learned the run had ended on a fault, and Follow-Me silently re-armed on the next keepalive into a blocked ARMED state whose only field signal was the not-ready flag. The alarm is now also set for a standing heading-disagree fault; every other fault keeps the surprise gating exactly as it was. (3) COMMENT-ONLY: the note in front of the restored FM fault term claimed a HOLD-parked Follow-Me would sit at cap 0 "for the rest of the session". The throttle-release clear rescues FM_HOLD back to FM_ARMED after 10 continuous seconds below 25 counts, so the accurate hazard is narrower — a rider FEATHERING the trigger restarts that timer on every squeeze, never accumulates the 10 s, and gets a dead motor on every squeeze with no explanation. Plus heading_disagree_fault is now volatile: it is read cross-task by Logger.ino through headingDisagreeLatched(), and as a file-scope static whose address never escapes the compiler may cache it. Read-only, log columns only, no control impact. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - THREE CORRECTIONS TO THE DEGRADATION PASS BELOW, WHICH ASSUMED THE COMPASS WAS THE LIAR. The cross-check proves only that the compass and the GPS course CANNOT BOTH BE RIGHT. It does not say which one is wrong — the guard says so itself in guard 2's own header: "It deliberately does NOT pick a winner." Degrading the session onto GPS course alone picks one anyway, and it picks the compass as the culprit; if the RX's course is the bad source instead (marina multipath, a wrong dynamic platform model, a lagged COG at low speed) the degradation withdraws the GOOD sensor and operates on the bad one. (1) FOLLOW-ME REFUSES AGAIN — RELEASE BLOCKER. !heading_disagree_fault is back in can_be_active, and back in the FM fault-stop classifier it was deleted with, so a disagreement proven mid-engagement ends the run through the existing FM_STOPPING ramp (back to manual, re-arm required) instead of parking FM in FM_HOLD at cap 0 for the rest of the session. RTM KEEPS DEGRADING, and that part was sound: RTM's degraded behaviour is BOUNDED — with no heading the steering override is pinned at 127 and the align cap holds the throttle at 13/255 on the 180 deg sentinel — and the alternative was a genuinely dangerous half-armed state, buggy dead with the throttle at 0 while the TX still displayed RTM as ACTIVE. FOLLOW-ME IS NOT BOUNDED LIKE THAT: it engages autonomously at rider speed plus a margin, its steering authority is continuous, its only backstops are the divergence fault (about a 6.5 s grace plus a 3 s dwell) and the deadman — and the disagreement is UNMEASURABLE during the engagement, because compare_possible needs a compass snapshot younger than kHeadingCompareSnapMs and the snapshot only refreshes while thr_received < 25, so about a second into the run the comparison goes dormant and COG is served at confidence 3 unchallenged. Refusing to engage is the right answer to "one of my two heading sources is lying and I cannot tell which", and it is the same answer guard 1 already gives a few lines up: HOLDING STRAIGHT IS SAFER THAN STEERING ON THE SURVIVOR. The rider is not left guessing: the one-shot degradation notice still prints, the rate-limited "ARMED, NOT ENGAGING" explanation is restored, fm_flags bit 2 (armed-not-ready) carries the fault again so the TX cannot render "ready" for a Follow-Me that will not engage, and ?diag now reports the latch on demand. (2) THE kCogHoldMs COG HOLD SURVIVES DEGRADATION. The fault term moved back BELOW the hold, to the site it occupied before. The hold serves a last-good GPS COURSE, and the latch is evidence about the COMPASS, so withdrawing a GPS-derived value on compass evidence was outside this guard's charter — and it cost real behaviour twice over: a COG dropout longer than 1.5 s failed FM's condition 6 and forced a stop-and-re-arm the hold would have bridged, and on the RTM side the documented cog_valid flicker in the 3-4 km/h approach band (rtm_target_speed_kmh 4.0 against rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh 3) alternated the steering override between centre and bearing at 10 Hz. Degraded now means precisely "mode 1 minus the compass", which is what the evidence supports. (3) THE CLEAR IS AS STRICT AS THE SET. Setting the fault needs at least four measured samples spanning 5 s of continuity; clearing it took ONE agreeing tick. For a MIRRORED module the reported heading is theta - h_true, so the gap is 2*h_true - theta, which passes below 45 deg in two 45-deg-wide windows per revolution — a rider coasting near one of them cleared the latch instantly with the module still mirrored, and that is exactly the fault ?magalign cannot detect. Agreement must now hold continuously for kHeadingDisagreeMs with measured samples no more than kHeadingDisagreeGapMaxMs apart, mirroring the set. No new config field, no threshold retuned, no confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - A HEADING DISAGREEMENT NOW DEGRADES THE SESSION INSTEAD OF REFUSING IT. WHAT SHIPPED BEFORE: a proven heading_disagree_fault withdrew the compass fallback (correct) and then refused to run on what was left (wrong). Gate 6 is enforced whenever usrConf.rtm_compass_required is set, which is the default, so on a stationary arm there was no heading at all, the gate raised rtm_rx_emergency_stop and the buggy sat dead with the throttle pinned at 0 — while gates 2-8 deliberately do NOT clear rtm_rx_active, so the TX went on displaying RTM as ACTIVE. Follow-Me had the twin of it: can_be_active carried !heading_disagree_fault, so FM sat in FM_ARMED for the rest of the session. The rider armed, nothing moved, and the remote said it had. WHAT IT DOES NOW: the COMPASS is the sensor that was caught lying; the GPS course is not, so refusing to run threw away a good source because a different one failed. A standing fault now degrades the session to COG-only — which is exactly usrConf.rtm_use_compass == 0, an existing, documented, supported mode — instead of refusing: getRtmHeading() takes the mode-0 path for heading SELECTION while the fault stands (live GPS course above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh, nothing below it: no compass fallback and no kCogHoldMs hold, because mode 0 has neither), gate 6 is bypassed exactly as it is for a rider who has set rtm_compass_required = 0, FM's can_be_active and its fault-stop chain no longer carry the flag, and fm_flags bit 2 stops calling it armed-not-ready. The rider's experience becomes the ordinary COG-only one: get the buggy moving and the GPS course takes over. NOTHING IS WRITTEN TO usrConf — rtm_use_compass and rtm_compass_required are untouched, no SPIFFS write, no ?conf change; this is runtime degradation for the session only. THE COMPARISON ITSELF STILL RUNS IN THE CONFIGURED MODE (compare_possible keeps testing the stored mode, not the degraded one), because that measurement is the evidence route that clears the fault. AND BECAUSE THE FLAG NO LONGER BLOCKS ANYTHING, THE LATCH IS NOW STICKY: the disarm-edge clear in runRtmLoop() and the FM-idle clear in fmEnterIdle() are GONE — they forgave a proven fault with no evidence, so a mis-mounted compass had to be re-proven by coasting on every single run. Exactly three clear routes remain: a live measurement showing the two sources agreeing again, a SUCCESSFUL ?compasscal (CAL_FULL only) or ?magalign — the rider actually fixing the mounting, wired in Compass.ino — and a reboot. A PARTIAL or failed calibration does NOT clear it. The rider is told once on serial, the moment the degradation engages, what happened and how to fix it. Subtract-only throughout: the flag grants no heading, raises no cap, extends no engagement, and it now removes strictly MORE heading than before. No threshold retuned, no confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - The heading-disagree backstop threw away the only evidence it ever gets. THE EVIDENCE WINDOW: a comparison needs a live COG *and* a compass snapshot less than kHeadingCompareSnapMs (1000 ms) old, and updateCompassSnapshot() only refreshes the snapshot while thr_received < 25, because a snapshot taken under motor current is worthless. RTM and FM both require a HELD trigger. So about one second into any engagement the comparison goes dormant and the kHeadingDisagreeMs (5 s) dwell can never complete inside a run — the ONLY time both inputs exist together is when the rider is coasting with the trigger released above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh, or during the arm ceremony, where the TX pins the throttle byte to zero. The previous pass then added an ARM-EDGE clear that wiped heading_disagree_fault at exactly that boundary, i.e. it discarded the freshest evidence available anywhere in the sequence and left the guard unable to act on anything it had proven. FIX: the arm edges (rtm_rx_active false -> true in runRtmLoop, and the FM_IDLE -> armed edge in runFmLoop) now clear only the UNFINISHED dwell (heading_disagree_since_ms, heading_disagree_last_seen_ms). A PROVEN fault survives into the engagement, where getRtmHeading() consumes it by withdrawing the compass fallback. The DISARM edges (rtm_rx_active true -> false, and a genuine transition into FM idle via fmEnterIdle) still clear all three, so this is still not a power-cycle latch, and a live measurement showing the two sources agreeing again still clears it outright. Because a surviving fault can now refuse an engagement, both refusals were made to SAY SO instead of being silent: RTM gate 6 prints the real cause (a compass caught disagreeing with GPS course) rather than the misleading generic "No valid heading source", and FM — which would otherwise sit in FM_ARMED with the TX reading "ready" — now raises fm_flags bit 2 (armed-not-ready) and prints a rate-limited explanation. Subtract-only throughout: the flag grants no heading, raises no cap and extends no engagement. No threshold retuned, no confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - SAFETY (release blocker): rtm_steer_override could survive an idle period and be applied on the first tick of the NEXT engagement. Only gate 1 (throttle released) and updateRtmSteering() ever wrote the neutral 127, so a GATE 9 HANDOFF WITH THE TRIGGER STILL HELD left the last bearing-derived value — say 210 — parked indefinitely: the inactive path in runRtmLoop() returned without touching it and fmEnterIdle() deliberately does not touch it either. calcPWM() applies the override whenever (rtm_rx_active || fm_rx_active) && rtm_rx_override_steering && thr_received >= 25, so on the next re-arm the 100 Hz generatePWM task could put that stale bearing on the motors as differential steering before runRtmLoop() recomputed it — with no gate 9 and no Phase C in the path. Normally a 100 ms window; UNBOUNDED if the re-arm lands while the loop task is frozen inside a deliberately non-abortable command (?gpssetup, ?wifiupd), since runRtmLoop() is then not running at all. FIX: runRtmLoop() now forces rtm_steer_override = 127 on every tick where BOTH rtm_rx_active and fm_rx_active are false. The !fm_rx_active term is load-bearing, not defensive — runRtmLoop() runs BEFORE runFmLoop() in loop(), so an unconditional reset would publish a neutral 127 for one preemption window per cycle throughout every Follow-Me engagement (RTM is inactive for all of one) and stutter FM steering to centre at 10 Hz; same hazard fm_throttle_cap has its own global to avoid. Subtract-only: writes the neutral value only, never a turn, never throttle. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - Follow-up to the edge-clear fix below; three items, all in the heading-disagreement guard. (1) THE LATCH NOW ALSO CLEARS AT THE ARM EDGE, not only at the disarm edge. runRtmLoop() calls getRtmHeading() unconditionally every 100 ms to fill the fm_status telemetry byte, so the disagreement dwell runs during ORDINARY MANUAL RIDING with nothing armed: a rotated or uncalibrated compass plus five seconds of coasting above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh with the trigger released (snapshot still refreshing, COG live) was enough to latch the fault before the rider had armed anything. Once both clears became edges, nothing forgave that. The rider then declared FM, separation latched, and FM sat in FM_ARMED for the rest of the session - silently, because fm_flags bit 2 (armed-not-ready) DROPS once separation latches so the TX reads "ready", and the HEADING DISAGREE FAULT printf only runs when FM was already engaged. RTM had the same dead end by a different road: gates 2-8 set rtm_rx_emergency_stop WITHOUT clearing rtm_rx_active, so a TX that dies mid-tow leaves rtm_rx_active stuck true, the disarm edge never fires, and the "fresh agreement" clear is unreachable because the emergency stop pins throttle at 0, so the buggy cannot move, so COG never goes valid. Both are answered by clearing at the START of an engagement as well as the end - the rtm_rx_active false -> true edge in runRtmLoop(), and the FM_IDLE -> armed edge in runFmLoop(). This cannot weaken the guard: the flag only ever SUBTRACTS eligibility, and a genuine disagreement re-proves itself within kHeadingDisagreeMs (5 s) of the run starting, so the cost is at most 5 s of protection at the very beginning of an engagement. (2) THE 15 s EVIDENCE CAP BOUNDED THE OTHER DEFECT BUT DID NOT REMOVE IT: it measures the SPAN from the start of the dwell, not the age of the last measurement, so one disagreeing tick at t=0 and one more at t=14 s passed the cap and then satisfied "held continuously for 5 s" immediately - a fault built from two isolated one-tick samples fourteen seconds apart. Persistence is now required to be CONTINUOUS: consecutive measured disagreements no more than kHeadingDisagreeGapMaxMs (2 s) apart, so at least four samples must span the dwell. The freeze-don't-clear behaviour the short COG handover needs is untouched. (3) Comment-only: the prose in front of the COG hold claimed the function hands out no heading at all once the latch sets. It still serves a HELD COG at confidence 2 for up to kCogHoldMs, deliberately - the latch is evidence against the COMPASS, and a held COG is not the compass - so the comment now states what the code does instead of asserting more. No threshold retuned, no ordering changed, no confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - The heading-disagree backstop was INERT, and it was inert in the exact mode it was extended to protect. fmEnterIdle() zeroed heading_disagree_since_ms and heading_disagree_fault on every call, and runFmLoop() calls fmEnterIdle() on every 100 ms tick whenever FM is idle — a condition that INCLUDES rtm_rx_active. So for the whole duration of any RTM run the dwell timer and the latch were being wiped ten times a second: the kHeadingDisagreeMs (5 s) dwell could never accumulate, the fault could never be set, and the check that consumes it in getRtmHeading() (in front of the compass fallback) could never see anything. In RTM-only operation — the field case this was built for, a buggy that veered at close range and never came back — the advertised sticky backstop did nothing. FIX 1: the clear in fmEnterIdle() is now EDGE-triggered on a genuine transition into FM idle (a real end of an FM declaration), not re-applied every tick, so the latch survives across ticks WITHIN an engagement. FIX 2: RTM gained its own end-of-engagement clear at the top of runRtmLoop() — an edge on rtm_rx_active going true -> false — so a proven fault is forgiven when the rider disarms and cannot outlive the run that produced it (it is NOT a power-cycle latch). Deliberately an edge there too: clearing it at every tick RTM is inactive would recreate the same bug for Follow-Me, which only ever runs while RTM is inactive. FIX 3 (the freeze-age MEDIUM): the "no comparison possible" branch froze the dwell timestamp indefinitely, so two one-tick disagreements minutes apart escalated as one "sustained 5 s" fault; a part-finished proof older than kHeadingDisagreeEvidenceMaxMs (3x the dwell) is now discarded, while a PROVEN fault is untouched. Nothing here grants a heading, raises a cap or extends an engagement — the guard can still only subtract. cog_last_good_deg/ms are no longer static so Logger.ino can read (never write) them. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 2 (RX heading-source trust guards, RTM + FM): the bench ?diag on the repaired board read "COG : 7.4 timestamp-updates/s vs 0.0 value-changes/s [value frozen 533 s]" — the GPS repeated ONE course seven times a second for nine minutes while gps_last_course_ms kept refreshing, so getRtmHeading()'s 1500 ms freshness gate passed the whole time and the ladder steered on a dead number, then fell back to the EMI-biased compass. That is the Follow-Me veer. GUARD 1: the COG branch now also requires the course VALUE to have moved within kRtmCogFrozenMs (3 s), read from the existing Stage 0 tracker g_diag_cog_change_ms — and it is SPEED-GATED to the same gps_last_speed_kmh >= rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh term the branch already used, so a stationary buggy (whose constant course is correct, not faulty) is never touched. A COG frozen WHILE MOVING additionally suppresses the mode-1 compass promotion: one source is provably dead and the other unverifiable, so we hold straight instead of steering on the survivor. GUARD 2: when a live COG and a simultaneous (< kHeadingCompareSnapMs) compass snapshot are both available in hybrid mode, a shortest-angular-distance gap > kHeadingDisagreeDeg (45) returns NO heading (confidence 0) so updateRtmSteering() holds straight; sustained past kHeadingDisagreeMs (5 s) it sets heading_disagree_fault, which joins the EXISTING FM fault chain alongside A3's diverge_fault (FM_STOPPING -> cap 0 -> ramp -> FM_IDLE, re-arm required) — no new state, no new exit path. Both guards can only REMOVE eligibility: no throttle cap is raised, no engagement extended, the deadman (thr_received < 25) is untouched. Logger.ino's inline getRtmHeading() duplicate is updated in lockstep so rtm_source/rtm_confidence keep telling the truth. All compile-time constants (shared, in BREmote_V2_Rx.h); no confStruct change, sizeof stays 184, SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F3-c (RX FM): the 8 m engage-distance floor guarded ONLY the manual fm_engage_dist_m value. The AUTO branch — kFmEngageFactor (1.5) x (min_dist_m + followme_smoothing_band_m) — used its product raw, and neither of those two SPIFFS fields has a lower bound, so a small tuning such as min_dist 1 + band 1 produced d_engage = 3 m: BELOW the measured 20 ft / 6.10 m tow rope, letting Follow-Me latch and engage with the rider still ON the rope. Same hazard the floor exists to prevent, reached through the other branch. FIX: each branch now only computes its candidate and ONE kFmEngageDistFloorM clamp is applied to the final d_engage regardless of origin. The clamp can only RAISE d_engage (engage later, never earlier), and it is a no-op at the owner's 4+2 tuning, which yields 9.0 m. Also swept the stale "6.7-7.6 m" tow-rope prose in this file to the measured 6.10 m. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 184, SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F3-b (RX FM; comment + shared-constant move, no behaviour change): kFmEngageDistFloorM is no longer DEFINED in this file. It now has exactly one definition, in BREmote_V2_Rx.h, raised 5.0 -> 8.0 m — 5.0 m sat below the tow rope it exists to clear (the owner's rope is 20 ft = 6.10 m), so a manual fm_engage_dist_m of 5.0-6.1 m was legal and let FM engage with the rider still ON the rope. ConfigService.ino's duplicate bare 5.0f literal is gone with it; both the validator and the read-site clamp in runFmLoop() now reference the one shared constant. The clamp itself is unchanged in shape — legacy stored values still clamp UP to the floor, now 8.0 m. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 184, SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - Batch A follow-up (Rex A3 NO-GO: F1/F3/F5/F7), RX FM only. (F1) the A3 divergence detector was a BARE THRESHOLD on a 3000 ms dwell while the engage ramp is 3500 ms, so it could fire BEFORE the ramp even finished and aborted ordinary engagements (at engage, dist_m is typically 13-21 m against an 18 m ceiling, and the align cap of 13/255 means the gap GROWS first). It now mirrors runPhaseC()'s actual shape: the distance at dwell start is captured (fm_diverge_start_dist_m) and the fault is raised at dwell expiry ONLY if the buggy is not closing (dist_m >= start - kFmDivergeCloseEpsM 2.0 m); if it has closed by more than that it IS following, just far, so the timer clears and no fault fires. Plus an engage grace: the detector is skipped and its dwell parked for kFmEngageRampMs + kFmDivergeMs (6.5 s) after every engagement so the buggy is allowed to ramp and align before it is judged. (F3) fm_engage_dist_m gained a 5 m floor — a stored value of, say, 3 m IS the engage distance in metres and is SHORTER than the 6.7-7.6 m tow rope, which defeated the separation interlock entirely; cfgValidateCrossField() now accepts only 0 (auto) or >= 5.0 m, and the use site clamps defensively so a pre-existing stored value cannot slip through. (F5) corrected the A2 comment that claimed d_engage feeds the distance Schmitt hysteresis - it does not; the Schmitt uses min_dist / min_dist+band. (F7) the divergence Serial.printf now runs AFTER fm_throttle_cap = 0 so UART backpressure can never defer the hard stop. All compile-time constants; no confStruct change, sizeof stays 184, SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - Batch A (A2+A3), RX FM only. (A2) fm_engage_dist_m is now READ: >0 sets the FM engage distance directly in metres (rope x ~1.15), 0 keeps the previous auto behaviour (kFmEngageFactor x d_follow) bit-for-bit; latch, dwell and Schmitt hysteresis untouched. (A3) FM divergence FAULT — runFmLoop() gained the upper distance bound it never had: condition 8 is a lower bound only, and runPhaseC()'s convergence check is RTM-only (called from runRtmLoop, never runFmLoop), so a wrong heading let FM steer away indefinitely. dist_m > kFmDivergeFactor(2.0) x D_engage sustained kFmDivergeMs(3000) while FM_ACTIVE now routes through the EXISTING fault path (FM_STOPPING ramp -> FM_IDLE, re-arm required, same haptic/St semantics as conditions 2-7). Non-blocking first-exceed timestamp, cleared on any condition/state/data-trust change. Subtract-only: adds no throttle, extends no engagement, does not touch the deadman. All compile-time constants; no confStruct change; SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-19 - P3 FM (DESIGN_FOLLOW_ME.md sections 4-7): Follow-Me autonomous following. Adds runFmLoop() 10Hz state machine (IDLE/ARMED/ACTIVE/DEMOTED incl. the missing 0xFF->usrConf.followme_mode fallback — SUPERSEDED 2026-07-20, see R0 below), all 9 activation/hold conditions with Schmitt hysteresis on distance and side-zone, the lag-anchor trailing target-point geometry, and the 5-stage subtract-only throttle cap chain. Reuses the existing EMA filter / P+D / heading ladder / authority / wrap pipeline unchanged - updateRtmSteering() only gains a target selector (RTM = rider position, FM = trailing point). telemetry.fm_status bit0 now reports FM engaged rather than FM mode selected. No confStruct change; SW_VERSION stays 33.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - FM engagement semantics (R0/R1/R2): (R0) BOTH 0xFF->usrConf.followme_mode fallbacks removed — 0xFF now means FM_IDLE always, killing the latently-armed factory boot; usrConf.followme_mode is the TX arm-gesture seed only. (R1) separation latch: FM's FIRST entry into ACTIVE now also requires dist > kFmEngageFactor(1.5) x d_follow sustained kFmSepDwellMs(2000) — the tow rope (6.7-7.6 m) is longer than the old engage distance, so FM could engage mid-tow; existing Schmitt hysteresis governs after the latch sets. (R2) two clears include the restored continuous 2 s throttle-release recovery and no 0xF2 refresh for kFmModeAgeMs(95 s) -> FM_IDLE.

(C) originally implemented steer-cancel while ACTIVE. [SUPERSEDED 2026-08-26: manual steering temporarily wins without changing FM state or latch.] (D) fm_flags telemetry byte (repurposed reserved_tx_imu): armed/engaged/armed-not-ready/fault-stop-sticky(kFmFaultStickyMs).

// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-19 - FM triage (Fable audit §5): (1) no-fix engagement guard — getRtmHeading() returns confidence 0 unless a fresh RX GPS fix exists, so RTM/FM cannot report confidence 2 or engage with datetime_unix=0; (2) D-term differentiated only across consecutive same heading-source samples — skip the step on a source switch (COG<->compass) or a compass-snapshot re-snap to kill the ±300°/s Kd spikes

  //
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - AND IT IS ALSO BYPASSED WHILE THE HEADING-DISAGREEMENT LATCH STANDS.
  // WHAT THIS FIXES. getRtmHeading() withdraws the compass the moment that compass has been caught
  // disagreeing with the GPS course, which is right — but with this gate still enforced, a buggy
  // that is stationary or below rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh at arm time then had NO heading at all, so
  // the gate raised rtm_rx_emergency_stop and pinned the throttle at 0. Gates 2-8 deliberately
  // leave rtm_rx_active TRUE, so the TX went on showing RTM as active while the buggy was dead:
  // it half-armed. That is a refusal, and refusing throws away the GPS course — a source that was
  // never in doubt — because a different sensor failed.
  // WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD. A standing fault degrades the session to COG-only, and the point of
  // COG-only (usrConf.rtm_use_compass == 0) is that it is a real, documented mode with its own
  // documented arming behaviour: rtm_compass_required is what a COG-only rider turns off, because
  // demanding a heading before the craft is moving is exactly what a COG-only craft cannot supply.
  // So while the latch stands this gate behaves the way it does for that rider — it stands aside,
  // RTM arms, updateRtmSteering() holds the override at 127 (straight) for as long as there is no
  // heading, and the buggy acquires a real GPS course as soon as it is moving faster than
  // rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh. Every other gate is untouched, Phase C's convergence check still
  // watches the run, and the throttle stays whatever the rider's trigger asks for minus the caps.
  // SAFETY DIRECTION: this can only ever let RTM run WITHOUT a heading, never let it steer on a
  // heading it does not trust — the compass is still withdrawn inside getRtmHeading(), so nothing
  // downstream can steer on the sensor that was caught lying. No throttle is added: the align cap
  // (~5% of 255) applies for as long as no heading exists, because g_heading_error_dx10 stays at
  // its 0x7FFF sentinel and the align phase treats that as the worst case.
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - TWO PRECISIONS on the wording above. (1) "COG-only" is now exactly
  // "mode 1 minus the compass": the kCogHoldMs held-COG bridge is served as well as the live course,
  // because the hold is a GPS value and this latch is evidence about the compass. RTM's degraded
  // behaviour is unchanged in kind — it simply has one fewer gap in it. (2) THIS BYPASS IS RTM-ONLY
  // AND DELIBERATELY SO. Follow-Me does NOT degrade: can_be_active carries the fault, so FM declines
  // to engage while the latch stands. RTM may run headless because its headless behaviour is bounded
  // (override pinned at 127, align cap at 13/255, Phase C watching, rider's trigger the only

// ============================================================
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 2: HEADING-DISAGREEMENT STATE (guard 2)
//
// Two module-private timers. They are NOT confStruct fields, NOT telemetry, NOT logged as new
// columns — a guard firing is already visible in an existing level-4 log through rtm_source,
// rtm_confidence and cog_frozen_s.
//
// heading_disagree_since_ms : millis() when the COG-vs-compass gap first exceeded
//   kHeadingDisagreeDeg and has held it continuously since; 0 = not currently disagreeing, or no
//   comparison was possible this tick. Same first-exceed-timestamp shape as fm_sep_over_since_ms
//   and fm_diverge_since_ms: plain millis() bookkeeping, no delay, no spin.
//
// heading_disagree_fault : set once that gap has persisted for kHeadingDisagreeMs. This is the
//   ESCALATION — a transient disagreement only invalidates the heading for that tick, but a
//   sustained one means the COMPASS is genuinely wrong (it is the sensor the ladder can promote,
//   and the one this hardware biases under motor current).
//
//   V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - WHAT IT DOES NOW: RTM DEGRADES, FOLLOW-ME DECLINES. While it stands the
//   compass is withdrawn from the ladder, so RTM runs on GPS course alone; it is NOT a config
//   change (nothing writes rtm_use_compass or rtm_compass_required, nothing touches SPIFFS, the
//   rider's stored settings are exactly as they left them) and it is runtime state that dies with
//   the power cycle. Concretely, while the flag stands:
//     - getRtmHeading() withdraws the COMPASS and nothing else. Above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh the
//       live GPS course is served unchanged at confidence 3, and the kCogHoldMs held-COG bridge is
//       still served at confidence 2 across a short dropout. V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17: the hold used
//       to be withdrawn here too, on a consistency argument ("the hold is a mode-1 feature"); it is
//       back, because the hold serves a GPS COURSE and this latch is evidence about the COMPASS.
//       Degraded therefore means exactly "mode 1 minus the compass", which is all the evidence
//       supports — see the check below the hold in getRtmHeading();
//     - RTM gate 6 stands aside exactly as it does for a rider who set rtm_compass_required = 0,
//       so an arm can never be refused for lack of a heading — the buggy starts, holds straight,
//       and picks up a course as soon as it is moving. RTM's degraded behaviour is BOUNDED: with no
//       heading the override is pinned at 127 and the align cap holds the throttle at 13/255;
//     - FOLLOW-ME IS DIFFERENT AND DOES NOT DEGRADE. can_be_active carries !heading_disagree_fault
//       and the FM fault-stop classifier carries it too, so FM will not engage while the latch
//       stands and a latch proven mid-engagement ends the run through FM_STOPPING. FM engages
//       autonomously at rider speed plus a margin with continuous steering authority, and the
//       disagreement cannot even be measured during the engagement (the snapshot stops refreshing
//       the moment the trigger is squeezed), so declining is the only honest answer to "one of my
//       two sources is lying and I cannot tell which". See can_be_active in runFmLoop();
//     - mode 2 (compass-only, diagnostic) is the one place there is nothing to fall back to, so the
//       proven-bad compass is withheld and the function returns no heading at all. See there.
//
//   V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - WHERE IT IS CLEARED — EXACTLY THREE ROUTES, and every one of them is
//   EVIDENCE that the problem is gone. The engagement-boundary clears that used to be routes 2, 3
//   and 4 (fmEnterIdle(), the RTM disarm edge, the arm edges) are GONE. They existed only because a
//   standing fault could refuse an RTM arm and would otherwise have been un-clearable on the water;
//   RTM now degrades instead of refusing, so that reason is gone with them — and forgiving a fault
//   at every disarm meant a compass mounted 90 deg out had to be re-proven by coasting on every
//   single run, which is precisely the gap this closes. A mis-mounted compass is wrong every run.
//     1. A SUSTAINED MEASUREMENT SHOWING AGREEMENT — here, in the compare branch below. The
//        evidence is withdrawn, so the verdict goes with it. This still runs while the fault
//        stands, because compare_possible deliberately tests the CONFIGURED mode, not the degraded
//        one; without that, withdrawing the compass would have switched off the very measurement
//        that exonerates it.
//        V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - AND IT NOW TAKES AS MUCH EVIDENCE TO CLEAR AS TO SET. This route
//        used to fire on the FIRST tick where a comparison was possible and the two agreed: four
//        samples over five continuous seconds to convict, one sample to acquit. That asymmetry
//        broke on the case the latch matters most for. A MIRRORED module (an axis sign flipped by
//        the mounting) reports theta - h_true instead of h_true, so the gap between compass and
//        course is 2*h_true - theta, which sweeps the whole circle as the craft turns and passes
//        below kHeadingDisagreeDeg inside two 45-deg-wide windows per revolution. A rider coasting
//        on a heading near one of those windows cleared the latch instantly with the module still
//        mirrored — and mirroring is exactly the fault ?magalign cannot detect, so this route was
//        acquitting the one defect stickiness exists for. Agreement must now be measured
//        CONTINUOUSLY for kHeadingDisagreeMs, with consecutive measured samples no more than
//        kHeadingDisagreeGapMaxMs apart (so at least four of them, the same shape as the set), and
//        that dwell is tracked by heading_agree_since_ms / heading_agree_last_seen_ms below. Any
//        measured disagreement restarts it from zero. Making a clear HARDER can only ever leave a
//        proven fault standing for longer, which is the conservative direction for this guard.
//     2. A SUCCESSFUL ?compasscal (CAL_FULL only) OR ?magalign — the rider physically fixing the
//        mounting and re-measuring it. Wired in Compass.ino via headingDisagreeClearAfterCal();
//        a PARTIAL cal (iron saved, orientation NOT re-measured) and any failed/aborted run do NOT
//        clear it, because those are exactly the runs that leave the old mounting angle in place.
//     3. A REBOOT. The flag is a plain RAM global; it is not persisted anywhere.
//   And separately, the part-finished dwell (not the fault) ages out after
//   kHeadingDisagreeEvidenceMaxMs while no comparison is possible, is restarted from the current
//   sample if the measured disagreements themselves stop being contiguous (kHeadingDisagreeGapMaxMs),
//   and is dropped at both edges of an engagement so a half-built proof never spans two situations.
//   V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - the AGREEMENT dwell added for route 1 obeys the same two bounds, for the
//   same reasons: it ages out after kHeadingDisagreeEvidenceMaxMs while nothing is being measured,
//   and a gap longer than kHeadingDisagreeGapMaxMs between agreeing samples restarts it. It is NOT
//   dropped at engagement edges, and it does not need to be — the gap bound is the tighter test.
//   The measurement goes dormant about a second into any engagement (the snapshot stops refreshing

//   agreeing sample after the run arrives far more than kHeadingDisagreeGapMaxMs late and opens a
//   fresh dwell of its own.
//
//   V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - WHY THE ENGAGEMENT-BOUNDARY CLEARS WENT, IN FULL, because the argument
//   that put them there is the argument that now takes them out. They were added when a proven
//   fault could REFUSE an engagement: at that point a sticky latch risked becoming an un-clearable
//   arming block on the water, so every engagement boundary forgave it. The evidence window is
//   narrow — a comparison needs a live COG AND a compass snapshot younger than kHeadingCompareSnapMs,
//   and Compass.ino only refreshes that snapshot while thr_received < 25, so the only moments the
//   two inputs coexist are a rider COASTING with the trigger released above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh
//   and the arm ceremony itself — which meant those boundary clears were throwing away the only
//   evidence the guard ever gets, and the rider had to re-prove a bad compass by coasting on every
//   single run. The reason to keep the verdict is intact: a compass mounted 90 deg out is 90 deg
//   out on the next run too.
//   V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - AND FOLLOW-ME REFUSES ONCE MORE, WHICH DOES NOT BRING THE BOUNDARY
//   CLEARS BACK. The un-clearable-block worry the clears were built for is answered elsewhere and
//   better: RTM is not blocked at all (it runs on GPS course, so the buggy always comes home), and
//   the evidence route is exactly the state an FM rider is in between tows — coasting with the
//   trigger released, which is when the snapshot refreshes and the comparison is live. Forgiving
//   the verdict at a state boundary would hand autonomous following a compass the firmware holds
//   positive evidence against, on the strength of a state change that measured nothing.
//
//   WHY THE FLAG IS NEEDED AT ALL, given a disagreement already returns "no heading": the
//   comparison window is narrow by necessity (see kHeadingCompareSnapMs). The compass snapshot
//   stops refreshing the moment the rider squeezes the trigger, so a real disagreement can be
//   measurable on one tick and unmeasurable on the next — at which point COG alone would look
//   valid again and FM would happily resume steering on the source we just proved suspect. The
//   flag is what stops a proven fault from being washed out by its own evidence going stale.
//
//   RTM CONSUMES IT TOO (this paragraph used to say only FM did). The 2026-08-16 close-range veer
//   changed that: getRtmHeading() itself withdraws the compass while the fault is latched, so every
//   caller inherits it — RTM, FM and anything added later. The original objection was that a sticky
//   fault could become an un-clearable arming block on the water. V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17: that
//   objection is answered at the root instead of by forgetting the evidence — the fault cannot
//   block an RTM arm any more, because gate 6 stands aside while it stands and RTM simply runs on
//   GPS course. The worst case for RTM is therefore a session on GPS course alone, not an aborted
//   run and not a refusal. V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17: FOLLOW-ME IS THE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION — it
//   declines to engage while the latch stands (see can_be_active in runFmLoop for why autonomous
//   steering must not be handed a heading the firmware holds positive evidence against), so for FM
//   the worst case is a manual buggy, which is the state it starts every session in. The way out is
//   the same for both: fix the compass (?compasscal / ?magalign), or let a sustained measurement
//   show the two sources agreeing again.
//
// CONCURRENCY: every caller of getRtmHeading() (gate 6, checkFmFaultConditions, the fm_status
// telemetry block, updateRtmSteering) runs in the loop task, so these statics are single-writer.
// Logger.ino's duplicate of this logic runs in loggerTask and READS the fault through the
// headingDisagreeLatched() accessor only — a read that cannot set, clear or age anything — so that
// mirror stays side-effect-free while still describing the same heading the controller chose.
// Compass.ino calls headingDisagreeClearAfterCal() from the ?compasscal / ?magalign commands, which

  //
  // Found by Rex auditing LATCH-1 (shipped the same day, 2026-08-18). LATCH-1 made the latch
  // survive a reboot, and in doing so removed clear route 3 — the reboot itself. That is correct
  // in mode 1 with a compass fitted, where routes 1 and 2 both work. It is a TRAP everywhere
  // else, because BOTH remaining routes need a working compass in hybrid mode:
  //
  //   Route 1, five seconds of measured agreement, runs only inside compare_possible, which
  //   begins `(mode == 1) && cog_valid && ...` — so on a COG-only board it can NEVER fire.
  //   Route 2, ?compasscal / ?magalign, needs a compass that answers.
  //
  // So a rider who latched the fault in hybrid mode and then set rtm_use_compass 0, or whose
  // compass has since failed or been unplugged, would boot with Follow-Me blocked and NO route
  // out of it — permanently, on every subsequent boot, with the only escape being a compass they
  // no longer use or no longer have. Unrecoverable in the field is worse than the risk the latch
  // was guarding against, and LATCH-1 created it.
  //
  // The stale marker is DELETED rather than left in place, so the trap cannot re-arm itself on
  // the next boot. If the rider returns to hybrid mode with a working compass, a genuine
  // disagreement re-proves itself within kHeadingDisagreeMs of coasting — the evidence is cheap
  // to regather, which is exactly why it is safe to drop a verdict that can no longer be tested.

// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - A TEMPORARY LADDER THAT IS NOT A SETTING: while guard 2's latch stands,
// the COMPASS is withdrawn from this function — the live GPS course and the kCogHoldMs held course
// are both still served, so the ladder becomes "mode 1 minus the compass" rather than any stored
// mode. usrConf is READ, never written — the rider's rtm_use_compass and rtm_compass_required
// survive untouched, and the withdrawal disappears on the next boot or the moment the compass is
// re-measured or exonerated. Mode 2 is the exception: it has no COG to fall back on, so a standing
// fault there returns no heading at all.
// WHY THE HOLD STAYS (this was the other way round for one pass): the hold serves a last-good GPS
// COURSE and the latch is evidence about the COMPASS, so withdrawing the hold on that evidence
// removed something the guard has nothing against — and it cost a real bridge across the ordinary
// COG dropout. See the check that now sits BELOW the hold.
//
// SAFETY: This function still never modifies sensor state, config, telemetry or any control
//         variable. The only state it writes is the guard-2 bookkeeping declared directly above —
//         heading_disagree_since_ms, heading_disagree_last_seen_ms and heading_disagree_fault

//         measures the agreement dwell for clear route 1, plus the heading_degrade_announced
//         notification flag it sets through headingDisagreeAnnounceDegraded() — and the
//         cog_last_good_deg / cog_last_good_ms pair used by the COG hold. All of it is single-writer from the loop task.

  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - THE DEGRADATION NOTICE RETRIES HERE, EVERY TICK, UNTIL IT PRINTS.
  //
  // WHAT WAS WRONG. headingDisagreeAnnounceDegraded() defers while the trigger is held and returns
  // WITHOUT setting its one-shot flag, which is correct (see the F7 note on the function). But its
  // only call site was inside the if (disagree_now) branch far below — so the retry needed another
  // MEASURED disagreement, and a measurement needs a live COG together with a compass snapshot
  // younger than kHeadingCompareSnapMs, which only refreshes while thr_received < 25. Put those two
  // facts together and the deferral was not a deferral: if the dwell completed inside the ~1 s
  // window after a squeeze the notice was suppressed, and if the rider then finished the session
  // under power and never coasted above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh again, no further comparison was ever
  // possible and THE NOTICE WAS LOST. They rode the whole session with the compass withdrawn and
  // Follow-Me refusing to engage, with no indication anywhere except a manual ?diag.
  //
  // WHAT THIS DOES. Decouples the retry from measurability. While the verdict stands, every call of
  // this function offers to announce it, whether or not anything is currently comparable. Nothing
  // about the notice itself changes: heading_degrade_announced still makes it print exactly once per
  // fault, and the thr_received >= 25 deferral inside the function is untouched, so it still returns
  // early without arming that flag while the motor can be live.
  //
  // WHY THIS PLACEMENT CANNOT PUT A SERIAL CALL BETWEEN A PROVEN FAULT AND A MOTOR-STOPPING WRITE.
  // The function prints only when thr_received < 25, and every motor-relevant write this guard feeds
  // is only consequential while the trigger is HELD — calcPWM() applies rtm_steer_override and the
  // caps under thr_received >= 25, and below that the deadman already has the motor at 0. So on any
  // tick where this can print there is nothing left to defer. Call site by call site:
  //   gate 6 in checkRtmSafetyGates() — unreachable below 25 counts, because gate 1 returns first,
  //     so this line prints NOTHING there and cannot precede that gate's rtm_rx_emergency_stop;
  //   checkFmFaultConditions() — does run on released-trigger ticks and is upstream of
  //     fm_throttle_cap = 0, which is exactly the case the deferral was written for and exactly the
  //     case where cap 0 is redundant, the trigger being released already;
  //   updateRtmSteering() — reached only with the trigger held (RTM past its gates, or FM_ACTIVE
  //     via hard_ok), so again nothing prints;
  //   the fm_status telemetry call in runRtmLoop() — has no motor-stopping write downstream of it.
  // Placed ABOVE the no-fix guard below on purpose: a fault that is standing must be announceable
  // even on a tick with no usable GPS, which is the whole point of decoupling it from measurement.

  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - A LATCHED DISAGREEMENT LEAVES THIS MODE WITH NOTHING. Elsewhere the

  // been shown to conflict — they opted into a compass they believed was good.
  // SO WE WITHHOLD IT: no heading, confidence 0, and every consumer holds straight. That is

  // GUARD 1 — COG LIVENESS BY VALUE CHANGE, NOT BY TIMESTAMP
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 2
  //
  // WHAT THE BUG WAS. The four sub-conditions above ask "is a course present, in range, recent,
  // and are we fast enough for it to mean anything". None of them asks the only question that
  // actually matters: IS IT STILL MOVING. gps_last_course_ms is re-stamped by GPS.ino on every
  // valid course sentence, including a sentence that repeats the previous heading exactly. The
  // owner's bench ?diag caught precisely that: 7.4 timestamp-updates/s against 0.0
  // value-changes/s, one heading held for 533 s. Every tick of those nine minutes this branch
  // returned confidence 3 (HIGH) on a number that had not moved since before the run started,
  // and the steering controller drove on it. That is the Follow-Me veer.
  //
  // WHAT THE FIX DOES. It reuses the Stage 0 tracker rather than duplicating it: GPS.ino already
  // stamps g_diag_cog_change_ms every time the course VALUE moves by more than kDiagCogChangeDeg
  // (0.05 deg). If that stamp is older than kRtmCogFrozenMs, the number is frozen and COG is not
  // a heading source this tick. Nothing in GPS.ino is touched — this is a read.
  //
  // WHY IT IS SPEED-GATED, AND WHY THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL. A stationary buggy legitimately reports
  // the same course forever: that is a correct reading, not a fault, and faulting it would break
  // the low-speed RTM arm the owner relies on (it is exactly why the compass snapshot fallback
  // exists). So the freeze verdict is only formed while gps_last_speed_kmh >= cog_min_speed — the
  // same gate this branch already applies. Below that speed the guard does not exist, and COG is
  // rejected for being too slow exactly as it always was, falling through to the compass.
  //
  // WHY IT ALSO REQUIRES A FRESH TIMESTAMP. The verdict "the value is frozen" is only meaningful
  // while the module is actively pushing course sentences — that is the measured signature
  // (timestamp fresh, value stuck). If the timestamp itself has gone stale, that is the ordinary
  // stale-COG case which already falls through to the compass, and it is left behaving exactly as
  // it does today. This keeps guard 1 aimed at the one failure it was written for.
  //
  // SENTINEL: g_diag_cog_change_ms == 0 means no COG value has EVER been captured this session
  // (?diagz deliberately does not clear it). That cannot coexist with cog_fresh_ts, but if it
  // somehow did we form NO freeze verdict — we never suppress a source on the strength of a

  // measures the shortest angular distance between them. Beyond kHeadingDisagreeDeg they cannot
  // both be describing this buggy, so NEITHER is trusted: the function returns no heading
  // (confidence 0) and updateRtmSteering() holds straight. It deliberately does NOT pick a winner
  // — the entire lesson of the veer is that silently preferring the survivor is how you end up
  // steering on the wrong one.
  //
  // WHY ONLY IN MODE 1 (HYBRID). Mode 1 is the only mode in which the ladder can actually PROMOTE
  // the compass to a steering source, so it is the only mode where a bad compass can take the
  // buggy anywhere. In mode 0 the operator has declared the compass untrusted and it is excluded
  // from the ladder entirely — letting that same excluded sensor veto a good COG would invert the
  // meaning of the setting and import faults into the mode chosen to avoid them (and mode 0 needs
  // no help here: with COG gone it already returns nothing). Mode 2 returns above this point and
  // never consults COG at all; it is documented DIAGNOSTIC-ONLY, not for water.
  //
  // WHY THE COMPASS SNAPSHOT AND NOT A LIVE READ. getCompassHeading() is an I2C transaction that
  // takes the shared i2cMutex, and this function is called several times per 10 Hz tick from four
  // call sites — that is 40-60 extra bus transactions a second inserted into the control loop.
  // Worse, a live compass read under motor current is exactly the EMI-biased value this hardware
  // is known for, so it would manufacture disagreements and fault every engagement. The snapshot
  // is captured motor-idle by Compass.ino, which is the only compass reading this firmware trusts.
  //
  // TIMING HONESTY. Because the snapshot only refreshes with the trigger released, the comparison

  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 2
  //
  // THE SUBTLE PART, AND THE REASON THE VEER HAPPENED. Guard 1 invalidates COG. Left alone, the
  // ladder below would then do what it has always done and fall through to the compass — which is
  // EXACTLY the handover that steered the buggy the wrong way. Think about what we actually know
  // in this state: the GPS is provably dead (a register that stopped moving is not an opinion),
  // and the compass is unverifiable — the one instrument that could have cross-checked it is the
  // source we just threw away, and on this hardware the compass is biased 100 deg+ by motor
  // current at exactly the moment we would be relying on it (the buggy is moving, so the trigger
  // is held, so the snapshot is not even refreshing).
  //
  // One provably dead source plus one unverifiable source is not a heading. HOLDING STRAIGHT IS
  // SAFER THAN STEERING ON THE SURVIVOR: a buggy that holds its line is predictable and the rider
  // can see it and let go of the trigger, whereas a buggy steering confidently on a bad compass
  // goes somewhere nobody chose. So we return NOTHING.
  //
  // WHAT EACH MODE DOES WITH "NOTHING" — no new code path is invented for either:
  //   RTM: gate 6 stops the run only when rtm_compass_required = 1 AND the heading-disagreement
  //        latch is NOT standing; otherwise updateRtmSteering() holds the override at 127
  //        (straight) and RTM continues under the throttle governor with runPhaseC()'s convergence
  //        check still watching.
  //        V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - CORRECTION, because this used to say flatly that gate 6 stops
  //        the run at the default setting. It does not during a session in which the latch stands:
  //        that gate now stands aside whenever headingDisagreeLatched() is true (see the note at
  //        the gate), so a frozen COG on such a session behaves like the rtm_compass_required = 0
  //        case above — hold straight, keep running — rather than stopping. Stating it the old way
  //        described a stop that does not happen. The bypass is deliberately NOT narrowed here;
  //        narrowing it is a separate change with its own argument to make.
  //   FM : condition 6 in checkFmFaultConditions() fails, which is already classified as a FAULT
  //        — FM_STOPPING, cap 0, ramp back to manual, FM_IDLE, re-arm required. (And while the
  //        latch stands FM does not engage at all — can_be_active carries it — so this path is
  //        reached only with the compass exonerated or never accused.)
  //
  // THIS IS SELF-CLEARING AND STRICTLY NARROW. It only exists while the buggy is MOVING and the
  // GPS is repeating itself; the instant the course value moves again, or the buggy slows below
  // cog_min_speed, the ordinary ladder (including the compass fallback) returns unchanged. The

  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - FIELD BUG: RTM veered at close range.

  //

  // Reported by a beta tester: RTM tracked straight toward him, then turned hard at ~5-7 m.

  // The cause is a HANDOVER. RTM decelerates inside rtm_approach_zone_m, speed falls below

  // rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh, cog_valid goes false, and the heading source switches from GPS COG

  // to the compass snapshot. If the compass is mounted rotated - and before SW35 there was no

  // mag_orientation to correct it - the heading STEPS by the mounting angle at that instant and

  // the steering obeys it.

  //

  // Two guards should have caught that and neither did:

  //

  //   1. The per-tick cross-check needs compare_possible, which requires cog_valid. It can only

  //      run while COG is trustworthy - which is exactly NOT the moment the compass takes over.

  //      The check protects you while you do not need it and stands down when you do.

  //

  //   2. The sticky escalation heading_disagree_fault DID survive, but it was consumed only by

  //      runFmLoop(). Follow-Me was protected against a lying compass; Return-to-Me was not -

  //      runRtmLoop() never read it. An asymmetry between two loops sharing one sensor stack.

  //

  //      V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 CORRECTION to point 2: "DID survive" was wrong, and it was the

  //      false premise this whole block rested on. The latch survived nothing during RTM -

  //      fmEnterIdle() zeroed it on every 100 ms tick, and runFmLoop() calls fmEnterIdle() while

  //      rtm_rx_active is set. So the check added below was reading a flag that was being wiped

  //      ten times a second and could never be true in an RTM-only run.

  //

  //      V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 SECOND CORRECTION: the fix for that was to make both clears

  //      edge-triggered, and those two edge clears are now GONE ENTIRELY - the latch is cleared

  //      only by evidence (a sustained measured agreement, a successful ?compasscal / ?magalign)

  //      A reboot does NOT clear it (the verdict is stored in SPIFFS since 2026-08-18). It therefore survives across engagements, and the withdrawal described below

  //      is exactly what a standing fault does: it takes the COMPASS out of the ladder and nothing

  //      else. The check is a few lines below, between the COG hold and the compass fallback.

  //

  // Fixed at the SOURCE rather than in either loop: if the compass has been caught disagreeing

  // with COG by more than kHeadingDisagreeDeg for kHeadingDisagreeMs, THE COMPASS FALLBACK BELOW

  // is withdrawn - from RTM, from FM, and from any future consumer. Both callers already treat

  // 'no heading' correctly: updateRtmSteering() sets rtm_steer_override = 127 and holds straight,

  // which at close range is the safe outcome and is what the buggy should have done here.

  //

  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - SAY WHAT THE CODE DOES (third pass, and it is back to the second one).

  // The paragraph that first sat here explained why a HELD COG is still served while the latch

  // stands: the check sits BELOW the hold, and a held COG is a GPS measurement, not the compass

  // under suspicion. The pass in between moved the check above the hold and declared that

  // reasoning moot. It was not moot - it was the correct reading of what the latch is evidence

  // about, and the move quietly withdrew a GPS-derived value on compass evidence. The check is

  // back below the hold, so the original paragraph stands again and is restated here:

  //

  // A STANDING FAULT WITHDRAWS THE COMPASS AND NOTHING ELSE. Above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh a live

  // GPS course is served at confidence 3; for up to kCogHoldMs after that it is served held, at

  // confidence 2; after that there is no heading and every consumer holds straight. The cross-check

  // cannot say WHICH of the two sources is lying, so it may only remove the one it is about.

  //

  // THE DIRECTION IS STILL SUBTRACTION, which is the only direction this guard is allowed to move:

  // the compass leaves the ladder and nothing is added. What the previous pass cost, and what

  // moving the check back recovers, is real in both loops - a COG dropout longer than 1.5 s failed

  // FM's condition 6 and forced a stop-and-re-arm, and the cog_valid flicker in the 3-4 km/h

  // approach band alternated the RTM override between centre and bearing at 10 Hz, which is the

  // exact flapping the hold below was written to stop.

  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - HOLD the last good COG across a short dropout.

  // so cog_valid flickers on noise alone. Each flicker previously handed steering to a compass
  // that is 87-100 deg wrong under motor load, and the resulting hard turn SLOWED the craft,
  // which kept COG invalid, which kept the bad compass in charge. A closed loop with no exit:
  // that is the 'veers off and never recovers' a tester filmed.
  //
  // Four independent codebases - Betaflight, iNav, Ardumower, ArduPilot/PX4 - blend COG and
  // magnetometer continuously rather than switching between them. A full blend is a bigger
  // change than this craft needs today; holding the last good COG gets most of the benefit for
  // a fraction of the risk, and changes NEITHER threshold.

  // remember to check the flag for itself.
  //
  // WHY THE CHECK IS HERE AND NOT HIGHER UP THE LADDER. It sits BELOW the live-COG branch and BELOW
  // the kCogHoldMs hold, and above the compass fallback, because those are GPS courses and this is
  // evidence about the COMPASS. For one pass it lived up at the mode-0 return, which also withdrew

// WHAT FM DOES, IN PLAIN ENGLISH
// After the whip, the rider lets go of the rope and surfs the wave. FM makes the
// buggy trail the rider at a set distance and angle, steering itself, so the rider
// can keep their eyes on the wave instead of on the buggy.
//
// THE SAFETY RULES THIS CODE OBEYS (identical to RTM, non-negotiable):
//   1. The buggy ONLY moves while the rider physically holds the throttle trigger
//      (thr_received >= 25). FM never creates motion on its own.
//   2. FM ONLY steers and SUBTRACTS throttle. It can never add throttle. The human
//      trigger stays the one and only throttle source.
//   3. Releasing the trigger stops the buggy immediately (unchanged base architecture).
//   4. Every failure path - GPS, compass, LoRa, bad geometry - drives the motor to 0
//      by writing fm_throttle_cap = 0.
//
// FM writes exactly two things that can reach the motor: fm_throttle_cap (a cap that
// can only reduce throttle) and rtm_steer_override (steering only, and only while the
// trigger is held). Nothing else in this module touches the motor path.

// WHAT WAS MISSING. While FM is ACTIVE the distance condition (condition 8, in runFmLoop) is
// "dist_m >= min_dist" — a LOWER bound only. It answers "is the buggy far enough away to be safe?"
// and nothing else. If the steering is wrong — a mirrored steering_inverted, a compass 180 out, a
// bad course estimate — the buggy drives AWAY from the rider and that condition keeps passing more
// and more comfortably the further it gets. RTM does have a divergence net (runPhaseC's convergence
// check, "distance must be decreasing"), but runPhaseC() is only ever called from runRtmLoop() and
// never from runFmLoop(), so FM had no upper bound at all and would steer away indefinitely for as
// long as the rider held the trigger. These two numbers add that bound.
//
// WHY A CEILING AND NOT runPhaseC's "must be decreasing". RTM's rule is right for RTM: the buggy is
// commanded to close on a stationary rider, so any non-decreasing distance is wrong. FM is not
// closing — it deliberately holds station d_follow behind a MOVING rider, so distance legitimately
// rises and falls every wave and "must be decreasing" would fire constantly. What is never
// legitimate in FM is being far outside the follow geometry. So we keep runPhaseC's bookkeeping
// shape (a single sustained-condition timer, cleared the instant the condition stops holding) and
// change only the test itself.

// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The first cut of this detector was a BARE THRESHOLD: beyond the ceiling for
// kFmDivergeMs = a fault, full stop. That is wrong for two reasons that together aborted ordinary
// engagements. (1) The engage ramp is kFmEngageRampMs = 3500 ms, LONGER than the 3000 ms dwell, so the
// fault could fire before the buggy had even been given full throttle. (2) During align the cap is
// kFmAlignCap = 13/255 (~5%), so the buggy pivots on the spot and the distance GROWS before it starts
// to shrink — while at the engagement instant dist_m is typically 13-21 m against an 18 m ceiling
// (2 x 9 m). The result was FM aborting ~3 s into most real engagements and forcing a mid-session
// re-arm. THE FIX: judge the DERIVATIVE, not the level — exactly what runPhaseC()'s convergence check
// does ("dist_m >= rtm_prev_dist_m" -> not closing -> fail). We snapshot the distance when the dwell
// starts and, at dwell expiry, only fault if the buggy has NOT closed by more than this epsilon.
// WHY 2.0 m. The buggy's closing speed is capped by cap 3, the speed governor, at rider speed +
// kFmClosingMarginKmh = 5 km/h = 1.39 m/s, so over the 3 s dwell a genuinely closing buggy recovers

//                radius) or 9 (rider below foiler_low_speed_kmh), or the trigger was released
//                (DEADMAN). These are geometry / throttle pauses, NOT faults: the motor stops

//                FM_ACTIVE through the engage ramp once the conditions restore AND the separation

  //
  // WHAT THIS BLOCK DOES TODAY, IN ONE SENTENCE: on either edge of an RTM engagement it clears the
  // part-built disagreement dwell — heading_disagree_since_ms and heading_disagree_last_seen_ms —
  // so a half-finished proof can never span two different situations, and it does NOT touch
  // heading_disagree_fault at either edge. The verdict is cleared by evidence only: a sustained
  // measurement showing agreement, a successful ?compasscal / ?magalign. A reboot does NOT clear it (the verdict is stored in SPIFFS since 2026-08-18).
  //
  // EVERYTHING FROM HERE TO "WHAT EACH EDGE DOES NOW" IS HISTORY, kept because it is the reasoning
  // that constrains the answer. It describes a disarm-edge clear of the FAULT that no longer
  // exists: it was there to stop a sticky latch becoming an un-clearable RTM ARMING BLOCK, and that
  // block is gone — gate 6 stands aside while the latch stands, so RTM runs on GPS course instead
  // of refusing. With nothing left to unblock ON THE RTM SIDE, forgiving a proven fault at an RTM
  // boundary bought nothing and cost the rider a fresh proof on every single run.
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - AND IT MUST NOT COME BACK NOW THAT FOLLOW-ME REFUSES AGAIN. FM declining
  // to engage is the intended response to symmetric evidence (see can_be_active in runFmLoop), so an
  // RTM disarm — which says nothing whatever about a compass — forgiving that verdict would be the
  // same unearned amnesty in a different place. RTM keeps running throughout, so the rider is never
  // stranded by it, and the evidence-based clears remain reachable while coasting.
  //
  // WHY THIS EXISTED. The sticky heading_disagree_fault used to be cleared only in fmEnterIdle(),
  // which is a Follow-Me function. That was fine while only FM consumed the fault, but
  // getRtmHeading() now consumes it too (it refuses to hand out the compass fallback once the
  // compass has been caught disagreeing with COG), and in RTM-only operation FM never leaves
  // FM_IDLE, so that transition never happens and nothing would ever forgive the fault. Without
  // this block a rider who provoked one genuine disagreement would find the compass fallback
  // silently disabled for the rest of the session, with a power cycle as the only way out.
  //
  // WHAT IT DOES. Exactly what fmEnterIdle() does for FM, on RTM's own terms: the moment an RTM
  // engagement ENDS (rtm_rx_active goes true -> false, whether by TX disarm, Gate 9 handoff,
  // Phase C failure or rtm_rx_enabled being turned off), the latch and its part-finished dwell are
  // dropped so the next arm is judged on fresh sensor evidence.
  //
  // WHY IT IS AN EDGE AND NOT A LEVEL. Clearing it on every tick where RTM is inactive would
  // recreate the exact bug this pairs with — it would zero the latch ten times a second all the
  // way through every FOLLOW-ME engagement, since FM only ever runs while RTM is inactive.
  // Single-writer: this runs in the loop task, as does every other writer of these two.
  //
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - IT IS NOW BOTH EDGES, NOT JUST DISARM. TWO REASONS, AND THE SECOND ONE
  // IS WHY THE DISARM EDGE ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH.

  //   (a) THE DWELL RUNS WHEN NOTHING IS ARMED. getRtmHeading() is called unconditionally a few
  //       lines below, every 100 ms, purely to fill the heading-confidence bits of the fm_status
  //       telemetry byte — regardless of RTM or FM state. So the comparison, and therefore the
  //       5 s dwell, also accumulates during ordinary manual riding. A rotated or uncalibrated
  //       compass plus a coast above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh with the trigger released (the snapshot
  //       keeps refreshing while the motor is idle, so the comparison stays live) latches the fault
  //       before the rider has armed anything at all. With only end-of-engagement clears, nothing
  //       forgave that, and it then blocked the NEXT engagement from the inside — FM stuck in
  //       FM_ARMED with the TX showing "ready", because fm_flags bit 2 drops once separation
  //       latches and the explanatory printf in runFmLoop() only fires if FM was already engaged.
  //
  //   (b) THE DISARM EDGE DOES NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN. Gates 2-8 in checkRtmSafetyGates() set
  //       rtm_rx_emergency_stop but deliberately leave rtm_rx_active TRUE (only gate 9 and
  //       runPhaseC() clear it). So if the TX dies mid-tow — flat battery, gate 7 link loss — RTM
  //       stays "active" with the throttle pinned at 0 and this true -> false edge never arrives.
  //       The other clear route cannot help either: the emergency stop keeps the buggy stationary,
  //       so COG never goes valid, so no fresh comparison is ever possible. The fault would sit
  //       there until a power cycle, and the failure it then produced on the next arm was gate 6
  //       printing "No valid heading source", which points at the wrong cause entirely.
  //
  // WHY CLEARING AT ARM CANNOT WEAKEN ANYTHING. This flag only ever SUBTRACTS eligibility — it
  // grants no heading, raises no cap and extends no engagement. And a disagreement that is real is
  // still there when the run starts: it re-proves itself within kHeadingDisagreeMs (5 s) of the
  // first tick, because the same comparison runs on every tick of the run. So the price is at most
  // 5 s of protection at the very beginning of an engagement, and what it buys is the removal of
  // two dead ends that were both silent and both survived until a reboot.
  //
  // NOTE ON REACHING THE ARM EDGE AFTER (b): the TX begins every arm ceremony with a 0xF1/0 burst
  // ("armed but not yet active", TX RTMState.ino setRtmArmed()) before the 0xF1/1 that follows a
  // successful double squeeze. So even a stuck-true rtm_rx_active is driven false and then true
  // again by a re-arm, and BOTH edges of this test fire in the right order.
  //
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - THE TWO EDGES NO LONGER DO THE SAME THING. The paragraphs above argue
  // for clearing at BOTH boundaries, and for the dwell that remains correct — but clearing the
  // FAULT at the ARM edge made the guard incapable of ever acting, because the arm edge is where
  // the only usable evidence has just been gathered.
  //
  // WHY THE ARM EDGE IS THE EVIDENCE, NOT NOISE. A comparison requires a live COG and a compass
  // snapshot younger than kHeadingCompareSnapMs (1000 ms), and Compass.ino only refreshes that
  // snapshot while thr_received < 25 — a snapshot taken under motor current is worthless, which is
  // the entire premise of using a snapshot at all. RTM and FM both require a HELD trigger. So
  // roughly one second into any engagement the comparison goes dormant and the kHeadingDisagreeMs
  // (5 s) dwell can never complete inside a run. The two moments where both inputs genuinely
  // coexist are a rider COASTING with the trigger released above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh, and the arm
  // ceremony itself, during which the TX pins the throttle byte to zero and the snapshot is
  // therefore refreshing. Wiping a proven fault at that boundary discarded the freshest evidence
  // available anywhere in the whole sequence.
  //
  // WHAT EACH EDGE DOES NOW (V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 — BOTH EDGES DO THE SAME THING):
  //   DISARM (true -> false) and ARM (false -> true) both drop the UNFINISHED dwell and nothing
  //   else. A half-built proof must not span two different situations, so it restarts; a PROVEN
  //   fault is untouched at both edges and keeps the compass out of the ladder until it is cleared
  //   by evidence.
  //
  // WHY THE DISARM CLEAR OF THE FAULT WENT. It was forgiveness without evidence. A compass mounted
  // 90 deg out is exactly as wrong after a disarm as before it, so clearing there meant the rider
  // had to re-prove the fault by coasting with the trigger released on every single run — and the
  // proof takes kHeadingDisagreeMs of continuous measurement in a window that only exists while
  // coasting. In practice that made the guard nearly unreachable, which is the gap this closes.
  //
  // WHAT A SURVIVING FAULT ACTUALLY COSTS THE RTM RIDER, TRACED. If COG is live at arm time,
  // nothing: getRtmHeading() returns COG at confidence 3 well above the compass check, so the run
  // proceeds normally. If the buggy is stationary or below rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh — the ordinary RTM
  // arm — there is no heading unless the kCogHoldMs bridge still has one, and RTM ARMS ANYWAY:
  // gate 6 stands aside exactly as it does for a rider who set rtm_compass_required = 0, the
  // steering override holds at 127 (straight) and the align phase caps the throttle at ~5% until a
  // heading exists. The buggy moves off on the rider's own trigger, passes rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh,
  // and the GPS course takes over from there. What it never does is steer a towing buggy at a
  // person on a compass that has been measured 45+ deg wrong.
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - FOLLOW-ME PAYS A DIFFERENT PRICE, DELIBERATELY: it does not engage at

  //
  // WHAT THE BUG WAS. rtm_steer_override kept its last bearing-derived value indefinitely after an
  // engagement that ended without passing through the throttle-release path. Only two places ever
  // wrote the neutral 127: gate 1 in checkRtmSafetyGates() (trigger released) and
  // updateRtmSteering(). A GATE 9 HANDOFF WITH THE TRIGGER STILL HELD goes through neither —
  // rtm_rx_active is set false there, the inactive path a few lines below returns without touching
  // the override, and fmEnterIdle() deliberately leaves it alone as well (its comment says so: if
  // RTM has just armed, RTM owns it). So a value such as 210 sat there for the rest of the session.
  // The FM mode-age expiry in runFmLoop() has the same shape: it calls fmEnterIdle() straight out
  // of FM_ACTIVE, so the last FM steering value is left parked too.
  //
  // WHY THAT WAS DANGEROUS. calcPWM() applies the override whenever
  // (rtm_rx_active || fm_rx_active) && rtm_rx_override_steering && thr_received >= 25. Re-arming RTM
  // sets rtm_rx_active from the triggeredReceive task, and the rider squeezes the trigger moments
  // later — so the 100 Hz generatePWM task can apply the stale bearing as differential steering
  // BEFORE runRtmLoop() next recomputes it, with no gate 9 and no Phase C involved. Ordinarily that
  // window is one 100 ms tick. It is UNBOUNDED if the loop task happens to be inside a long
  // deliberately non-abortable serial command (?gpssetup, ?wifiupd) when the re-arm lands, because
  // then runRtmLoop() is not running at all and nothing recomputes the override.
  //
  // WHAT THIS DOES. Drives the override back to straight on every tick where NO steering owner
  // exists, so a stale bearing can never be left parked for the next engagement to pick up.
  //
  // WHY THE !fm_rx_active TERM IS NOT OPTIONAL. runRtmLoop() runs BEFORE runFmLoop() in loop()
  // (V2_Integration_Rx.ino), and the 100 Hz generatePWM task preempts freely between the two on
  // this single-core part. An unconditional write here would therefore publish a neutral 127 for one
  // window per cycle all the way through a FOLLOW-ME engagement — RTM is inactive for the whole of
  // one — and FM steering would stutter to centre ten times a second. That is precisely the hazard
  // fm_throttle_cap was given its own separate global to avoid; see the note on that atomic in
  // BREmote_V2_Rx.h. Gating on BOTH flags means this line can only run on a tick where nobody owns
  // the steering, and on such a tick the value is already 127 anyway — every FM exit path except
  // fmEnterIdle() writes 127 itself — so it can never change a value FM or RTM is using.
  //
  // WHY HERE AND NOT LOWER DOWN. This sits above the rtm_rx_enabled early return so it also covers
  // a board with RTM disabled in config, and above the inactive-path return so it covers the
  // ordinary disarmed case. On the ACTIVE path the condition is false, so a live RTM run reaches
  // updateRtmSteering() with its override untouched.

//
//   d_follow = min_dist_m + followme_smoothing_band_m   (owner default 4 + 2 = 6 m)
//
//   1. LAG ANCHOR. A first-order filter always trails a moving target by roughly v * tau
//      (13-18 m at 15-20 mph with tau = 2 s - larger than the follow gap itself, and it grows
//      with speed). If we simply sat d_follow behind the filtered position the buggy would fall
//      further behind the faster the rider went. So we first push an anchor point FORWARD along
//      the rider's course by min(v_rider * tau, 2 * d_follow), which cancels the filter lag and
//      makes the geometry speed-independent. The cap at 2 * d_follow stops a bad speed estimate
//      from throwing the anchor far up the track. This is deliberately NOT solved by shrinking
//      tau: the filter has to keep ignoring the rider's carves.
//
//   2. TRAILING POINT. target = anchor + d_follow at bearing (course + 180 + offset).
//
//   3. SIDE-ZONE SCHMITT. The diagonal offset is only applied while the buggy is reasonably
//      lined up behind the rider. We measure how far off the directly-behind axis the buggy
//      currently sits and run a Schmitt trigger on it (engage below zone_angle_enter_deg,
//      release above zone_angle_exit_deg, owner defaults 35 / 45). Outside the zone we fall
//      back to pure-behind. Without this hysteresis an unstable rider course could whip the
//      target point across the wake from one side to the other.
//
//   DEGRADED MODE. If the rider is too slow for a valid course, there is no meaningful "behind".
//   We hold station instead: put the target d_follow from the rider along the current
//   rider->buggy bearing, with no diagonal. The buggy holds its distance without manoeuvring
//   around what may be a rider in the water.
//
// ============================================================
// !!! OFFSET SIGN CONVENTION - VERIFY BEFORE WATER !!!
//
// This whole board works in ONE bearing convention: degrees CLOCKWISE FROM NORTH
// (0 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West). TinyGPSPlus::courseTo(),
// getCompassHeading() and GPS course-over-ground all return that convention, and
// projectPoint() above consumes it. Adding degrees to a bearing therefore rotates
// CLOCKWISE.
//
// Given that, with the rider travelling along course C:
//   directly behind the rider  = bearing C + 180
//   the rider's right-hand side = bearing C + 90   (clockwise from their heading)
//   the rider's left-hand side  = bearing C - 90
//
// So a "behind and to the rider's RIGHT" spot lies between C+180 and C+90, i.e. at
// C + 180 - near_diag_offset_deg. A "behind and to the rider's LEFT" spot lies between
// C+180 and C+270, i.e. at C + 180 + near_diag_offset_deg.
//
// Written as target_bearing = C + 180 + offset, that gives:
//   mode 1 Near-Right -> offset = -near_diag_offset_deg     (NEGATIVE)
//   mode 2 Behind     -> offset = 0
//   mode 3 Near-Left  -> offset = +near_diag_offset_deg     (POSITIVE)
//
// which matches DESIGN_FOLLOW_ME.md section 6 step 4 exactly. The single line that sets
// this sign is the "offset = -/+ usrConf.near_diag_offset_deg" pair below.
//
// ASSUMPTION BEING MADE: "Near-Right" means to the RIDER'S right as the rider faces along
// their direction of travel (not the buggy's right, and not the right of someone watching
// from the beach). Default mode 1 exists because the owner rides left-foot-forward, which
// puts the right side on their open/visible side - consistent with rider-relative.
//

  // Return-to-Me is NOT blocked (it runs on GPS course, so the rider can always get the buggy

  // agreement clears it. Forgiving it at a state boundary instead would hand Follow-Me a compass
  // the firmware has positive evidence against, on the strength of nothing at all.
  //

  // measurement showing agreement, a successful ?compasscal / ?magalign, and a reboot. See the

  //
  // HISTORY BELOW, kept because it is what constrains the edge test that remains.
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - EDGE, NOT LEVEL. WHAT THE BUG WAS: this clear ran on every call, and
  // runFmLoop() calls fmEnterIdle() on every 100 ms tick whenever FM is idle — and its FM_IDLE
  // condition includes rtm_rx_active. So THE WHOLE TIME RTM WAS RUNNING, the latch and its dwell
  // timer were being zeroed ten times a second. The 5 s dwell could never accumulate, the fault
  // could never be set, and the check that consumes it in getRtmHeading() (in front of the compass
  // fallback) could never see anything: in RTM-only operation — exactly the field case this
  // backstop was built for, a buggy that veered off at close range and never came back — the
  // advertised sticky guard did nothing at all.
  // WHAT THE FIX DOES: clear only on a genuine TRANSITION into FM idle, i.e. when an FM engagement
  // or declaration actually ends. Within an engagement — RTM's included — the latch now survives
  // across ticks, which is the entire point of it being sticky. RTM's own engagement-boundary clear
  // lives at the top of runRtmLoop() (both edges of rtm_rx_active), so neither loop depends on the
  // other one running to have its fault forgiven. FM's matching ARM-edge clear is a few lines into
  // runFmLoop(), just past the idle gate — see the block there for why the start of an engagement
  // needs a clear as well as the end.
  //
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - the !rtm_rx_active guard that used to protect the FAULT clear here is
  // gone with the clear itself. It existed because runFmLoop()'s idle gate includes rtm_rx_active,
  // so the tick on which RTM ARMS drives FM into idle and the clear would have wiped a proven fault
  // a few microseconds after RTM had decided to carry it into the run (loop() calls runRtmLoop()
  // before runFmLoop()). With no fault clear left at this site, that whole hazard is structural
  // rather than guarded: neither loop can forgive a compass verdict at a state boundary.

  // was armed. This is FM's half of the arm-edge clear; RTM's half is the rtm_rx_active
  // false -> true edge at the top of runRtmLoop(), which carries the full rationale.
  //
  // WHY IT IS HERE, ONE LINE BELOW THE IDLE GATE. Reaching this point means FM has a live TX
  // declaration, RTM does not own the buggy, and GPS/RTM are enabled — i.e. this tick is part of an
  // arm cycle. fm_state is still whatever the PREVIOUS tick left it as, and every tick that gets
  // past this gate ends by writing FM_ARMED, FM_ACTIVE, FM_HOLD or FM_STOPPING before it returns.
  // So "fm_state is still FM_IDLE here" is true on exactly one tick per arm cycle: the first one.
  // That makes this a genuine EDGE with no extra bookkeeping variable, and it covers both ways out
  // of idle (IDLE -> ARMED, and the rarer IDLE -> ACTIVE when the latch is already proven).
  //
  // AND IT IS DELIBERATELY BELOW THE GATE, NOT ABOVE IT. Above the gate this line would run on
  // every tick RTM owns the buggy — FM is held in FM_IDLE for the whole of an RTM engagement — and
  // that is exactly the wipe-every-tick bug this whole change set exists to undo.
  //
  // The clear runs BEFORE checkFmFaultConditions() below calls getRtmHeading(), so a disagreement
  // that is still genuinely present is re-measured and re-opens its dwell on this very tick; it
  // simply has to prove itself again over kHeadingDisagreeMs, from the start of the run.
  //
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - THIS EDGE NO LONGER CLEARS THE FAULT, ONLY THE UNFINISHED DWELL —
  // matching RTM's arm edge, and for the identical reason. The paragraph above says the fault
  // "simply has to prove itself again over kHeadingDisagreeMs, from the start of the run". IT
  // CANNOT: a comparison needs a compass snapshot younger than kHeadingCompareSnapMs, and
  // Compass.ino only refreshes that snapshot while thr_received < 25. FM engages under a HELD
  // trigger, so about one second into the run the comparison goes dormant and the 5 s dwell can
  // never complete. The evidence exists only BEFORE the run — while the rider coasts with the
  // trigger released above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh — so clearing the verdict here deleted the one
  // thing the guard had to work with. The unfinished dwell is still dropped, because a half-built
  // proof must not span two different situations.
  //
  // WHAT A SURVIVING FAULT COSTS FOLLOW-ME, AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT (V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17). It
  // makes can_be_active false, so FM stays in FM_ARMED, fully manual, cap 255, until the compass is
  // exonerated or re-measured. That is the intended behaviour, not a dead end: FM steers a towing
  // buggy at a person, and the guard's finding is "one of my two heading sources is lying and I
  // cannot tell which". Declining is the only answer that does not involve guessing. The real
  // complaint about the old shape was that it was SILENT — fm_flags bit 2 dropped once separation
  // latched, so the TX read "ready" while nothing happened. That is fixed where it belongs: bit 2
  // carries the fault again, the ARMED branch at the bottom of runFmLoop() prints a rate-limited
  // explanation, headingDisagreeAnnounceDegraded() prints once when the fault latches, and ?diag
  // reports the latch on demand. RTM, whose degraded behaviour is bounded, keeps running throughout,

    // 6.10 m rope) continuously for kFmSepDwellMs. The dwell is what makes this spike-proof:
    // a one-fix GPS glitch cannot hold the distance high across 4 consecutive 2 Hz fixes.
    // Once latched it survives ordinary moving operation below D_engage, so the buggy may close
    // back to its station without fighting the interlock. The separate reset above invalidates it
    // only after the rider is both back inside D_engage AND stationary for 2 s.
    // Same degenerate-config guard computeFmTarget() applies to d_follow: a zeroed min_dist
    // and band would otherwise make D_engage 0 and the latch would set on the first tick,
    // silently disabling the whole interlock.
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - A2: honour the fm_engage_dist_m override.
    // WHAT WAS WRONG: the field has existed in confStruct since SW34 and ConfigService validates it
    // (0-50 m), and the web UI shows a row for it — but no code anywhere ever READ it, so turning the
    // knob changed nothing. WHAT THIS DOES: when set above zero, the stored value IS the engage
    // distance, in METRES. It is NOT the rope length — MEASURE the rope and set at least a metre
    // beyond it (the measured 20 ft / 6.10 m rope -> 8 m, which is also the enforced floor).
    // 0 = auto: D_engage = kFmEngageFactor (1.5) x d_follow. The 0.1f compare is the
    // float "is this really zero" guard, not a second threshold — ConfigService already clamps the
    // range to 0-50 m.
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F3-c amendment: the auto branch is no longer bit-for-bit the pre-A2
    // behaviour — it is now floored at kFmEngageDistFloorM as well (see the F3-c block below). At
    // the 4+2 tuning auto yields 9.0 m, above the floor, so nothing changes at the shipped setting.
    //
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F5 comment correction. The A2 note here used to claim D_engage feeds
    // "the distance Schmitt hysteresis". IT DOES NOT, and saying so was misleading about what this
    // knob actually moves. The condition-8 Schmitt a dozen lines above works purely off min_dist and
    // min_dist + band; it never looks at D_engage. The three things that consume D_engage are: (1)
    // separation-latch SET immediately below, (2) stationary-near RESET above, and (3) the A3
    // divergence ceiling further down, which is kFmDivergeFactor x D_engage.
    //
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F3 defensive floor. WHAT THE BUG WAS: ConfigService accepted any value
    // in 0-50 m with no lower bound above zero, so a stored 3 m was legal — and 3 m is SHORTER than
    // the tow rope. Since this value IS the engage distance, that setting let FM engage while the
    // rider was still on the rope: the exact scenario the separation latch exists to prevent.
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F3-b: that floor was 5.0 m, which was itself below the rope it exists
    // to clear (the owner's rope is 20 ft = 6.10 m), so 5.0-6.1 m stayed legal and stayed on-rope.
    // It is now kFmEngageDistFloorM = 8.0 m, defined once in BREmote_V2_Rx.h and shared with the
    // validator — no duplicated literal.
    // WHAT THE FIX DOES: cfgValidateCrossField() refuses to STORE anything in (0, kFmEngageDistFloorM),
    // and the clamp below is the belt-and-braces companion for a value already sitting in SPIFFS from
    // before that rule existed — such a config is never re-validated, so without the clamp it would
    // still reach the latch. Behaviour is unchanged: a legacy stored value clamps UP to the floor.
    // 0 (auto) is still accepted by the validator and still takes the auto branch below.
    //
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F3-c: THE FLOOR NOW GUARDS BOTH BRANCHES, NOT JUST THE TYPED VALUE.
    // WHAT THE BUG WAS: kFmEngageDistFloorM used to be applied INSIDE the manual branch only. The
    // auto branch (fm_engage_dist_m = 0) computed kFmEngageFactor (1.5) x (min_dist_m +
    // followme_smoothing_band_m) and used that product RAW. Those two SPIFFS values have no lower
    // bound of their own — min_dist_m 1 m with a 1 m smoothing band is a perfectly storable tuning,
    // and it yields d_engage = 1.5 x 2 = 3 m. Three metres is BELOW the measured 20 ft / 6.10 m tow
    // rope, so Follow-Me could set the separation latch and engage with the rider still ON the rope:
    // the exact hazard the floor exists to prevent, simply reached down the other branch. The floor
    // was guarding the number the rider TYPES while leaving the number the firmware COMPUTES open.
    // WHAT THE FIX DOES: each branch now only computes its candidate, and ONE clamp is applied to the
    // final d_engage regardless of which branch produced it. The tow rope is a physical fact about
    // this buggy, not a property of the config path, so the safety limit belongs on the result.
    // WHY IT IS SAFE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: the clamp can only ever RAISE d_engage, never lower it. A
    // larger d_engage means the rider must separate FURTHER before FM may engage — it can only make
    // engagement later and harder, never earlier or easier.
    // NO-OP AT THE OWNER'S TUNING: min_dist_m 4 + followme_smoothing_band_m 2 = 6 m, x 1.5 = 9.0 m,
    // already above the 8.0 m floor. Nothing changes at the shipped setting; the clamp only bites on
    // a small-geometry tuning that would otherwise have produced an on-rope engage distance.
    // KNOCK-ON, CHECKED: the A3 divergence ceiling further down is kFmDivergeFactor x d_engage, so a
    // floored d_engage raises that ceiling in the same proportion — the detector becomes MORE
    // permissive, never less, and cannot be made to fire spuriously by this change.

    // WAY satisfies it more and more comfortably the further it runs. This adds the missing ceiling:
    // while FM is ACTIVE, being further than kFmDivergeFactor x D_engage from the rider AND FAILING
    // TO CLOSE for kFmDivergeMs is not "following badly", it is "not following", and it is a FAULT.
    //
    // V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - F1: this used to be a BARE THRESHOLD (beyond the ceiling for the dwell
    // = fault) and that aborted legitimate engagements. Two reasons, and they compound. First, the
    // engage ramp is kFmEngageRampMs = 3500 ms but the dwell is only kFmDivergeMs = 3000 ms, so the
    // fault could fire BEFORE the buggy had finished being given throttle. Second, while the heading
    // error is still large, cap 4 pins the throttle at kFmAlignCap = 13/255 (~5%) so the buggy pivots
    // in place and the gap GROWS before it starts to shrink — and at the engagement instant dist_m is
    // typically 13-21 m against an 18 m ceiling (2 x a 9 m D_engage). Net effect: FM aborted ~3 s into
    // most real engagements and forced a re-arm mid-session.
    //
    // THE FIX IS IN TWO PARTS, and both are needed:
    //
    //   1. TEST THE DERIVATIVE, NOT THE LEVEL. This is what runPhaseC() actually does — its
    //      convergence check fails on "dist_m >= rtm_prev_dist_m", i.e. on NOT CLOSING, never on being
    //      far. We do the same in FM's own terms: snapshot the distance when the dwell starts
    //      (fm_diverge_start_dist_m) and, at dwell expiry, fault only if the buggy has failed to close
    //      by more than kFmDivergeCloseEpsM. If it HAS closed by more than that, it is following — just
    //      from further back than we would like — so the timer is cleared and no fault fires. The next
    //      tick starts a fresh window, so a buggy that is beyond the ceiling and genuinely closing is
    //      re-tested every 3 s and keeps passing for exactly as long as it keeps closing.
    //      (Why "must be DECREASING" from runPhaseC is not copied verbatim: RTM closes on a stationary
    //      rider so any non-decrease is wrong, whereas FM holds station behind a MOVING rider and the
    //      distance legitimately rises and falls every wave. The epsilon is what carries that across.)
    //
    //   2. NON-AUTONOMOUS WINDOWS. The detector is skipped entirely, and its dwell parked, for
    //      kFmEngageRampMs + kFmDivergeMs (3500 + 3000 = 6500 ms) after every entry into FM_ACTIVE.
    //      The buggy must be allowed to finish ramping AND aligning before its geometry is judged;
    //      judging it mid-ramp measures the ramp, not the steering. Parking the dwell (rather than
    //      letting it run) guarantees the first post-grace window is a full, clean kFmDivergeMs.
    //      The same parking applies while the rider deliberately holds manual steering: distance
    //      then measures the rider's command, not FM convergence. A fresh divergence window starts
    //      only after the steering input is centred and FM is actually steering again.
    //
    // Bookkeeping is otherwise the same shape runPhaseC() uses: one timer plus one baseline, evaluated
    // every tick, both cleared the instant the condition stops holding, so nothing can accumulate
    // across a gap. The dwell is a plain first-exceed timestamp compared against millis() — no delay(),
    // no blocking, no extra loop.
    //
    // Only evaluated while fm_state == FM_ACTIVE (FM actually has control this tick). ARMED, HOLD and
    // STOPPING are all states in which FM is not steering, so distance says nothing about divergence.
    //
    // SAFETY: this branch only ever sets a flag that REMOVES eligibility. It cannot raise the
    // throttle cap, cannot extend engagement, and does not touch the deadman. Both parts of the fix

  //
  // V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - IT WAS REMOVED FOR ONE PASS AND IS RESTORED HERE. RELEASE BLOCKER.
  //
  // WHY THE REMOVAL WAS WRONG. It rested on "the flag is evidence against the COMPASS, so FM can
  // safely run on the GPS course instead". The cross-check does not support that sentence. It
  // proves only that the compass and the GPS course CANNOT BOTH BE RIGHT — guard 2's own header
  // says so: "It deliberately does NOT pick a winner." If the RX's course is the bad source
  // (marina multipath, a wrong dynamic platform model, a lagged COG at low speed), degrading to
  // course-only withdraws the GOOD sensor and hands Follow-Me the bad one. The evidence is
  // symmetric; the response must be too.
  //
  // WHY FOLLOW-ME DECLINES WHERE RTM DEGRADES — the two are not the same risk, and treating them
  // alike is what produced this. RTM's degraded behaviour is BOUNDED: with no heading the steering
  // override is pinned at 127, the align cap holds the throttle at 13/255 on the 180 deg sentinel,
  // Phase C's convergence check keeps watching, and the alternative was a half-armed buggy sitting
  // dead with the TX still displaying RTM as ACTIVE. FOLLOW-ME HAS NO SUCH CEILING: it engages
  // autonomously once the rider is beyond the engage distance at speed, its steering authority is
  // continuous for the whole engagement, and its only backstops are the divergence fault (about a
  // 6.5 s engage grace plus a 3 s dwell before it can even fire) and the deadman.
  //
  // AND THE DISAGREEMENT CANNOT BE RE-MEASURED DURING THE RUN, which is what makes engaging on it
  // unrecoverable rather than merely optimistic. compare_possible needs a compass snapshot younger
  // than kHeadingCompareSnapMs, and Compass.ino only refreshes that snapshot while thr_received <
  // 25. FM runs under a held trigger, so about a second into the engagement the comparison goes
  // dormant and the GPS course is served at confidence 3, unchallenged, for the rest of the run.
  // The firmware would be steering at a person on a source it holds positive evidence against,
  // with no way left to notice it was the wrong one.
  //
