// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - ?diag gained ONE line: whether the compass-vs-GPS-course disagreement latch is standing. WHY IT WAS NEEDED: that latch withdraws the compass from the heading ladder for the whole session and stops Follow-Me engaging, and until now there was no way to ASK the board about it. The one-shot serial notice prints at the instant the fault latches — typically while the buggy is on the bench, long before the rider is on the water — and then scrolls away, and the latch is deliberately not a confStruct field, not a telemetry byte and not a new log column, so nothing else could answer the question. ?diag is the right home: it is the non-blocking snapshot command, safe to run with RTM or FM engaged, and it already reports the COG-frozen evidence the same guard family is built on. Read-only — it calls the existing headingDisagreeLatched() accessor in RTMState.ino, which cannot set, clear or age anything. No new command, no confStruct change, no telemetry byte, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - COMMENTS ONLY, no code touched: the two version-tag lines below described the abort work INACCURATELY, and this file's header is the project's change record for it. (1) The first 2026-08-16 line listed six commands as "NOT reachable ... and NOT safely abortable part-way" - ?gpscfg, ?gpsbaud, ?gpssetup, ?download, ?deleteallogs, ?wifiupd - but FOUR of the six were given abort points in that very change (?gpscfg GPS.ino:1324/1347/1379, ?gpsbaud :1529/:1558, ?download Logger.ino:835, ?deleteallogs Logger.ino:932). Only ?gpssetup and ?wifiupd are genuinely non-abortable, and that is a deliberate choice rather than an omission, so the line now names those two and says WHY they are excluded. (2) The second 2026-08-16 line still counted ?i2c among the one-shot reads "deliberately NOT gated", but ?i2c was reclassified blocks_loop in the same change and now has an abort point - 126 addresses x a 20 ms I2C timeout is up to ~2.5 s of frozen loop, which is not a one-shot read. Both sentences now state what the code actually does. No logic, dispatch table, gate or abort site was modified. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - SAFETY, three follow-ups to the command-gating work described below. (1) The "not while engaged" rule is now asked a SECOND time, from INSIDE every blocking command, via the new rxAbortIfEngaged(). rtm_rx_active/fm_rx_active are set from the triggeredReceive task, so an arm from the remote can land AFTER a bench command was correctly allowed to start on an idle buggy - and until now that bought the command's whole duration (120 s for ?magtest) with no safety gate evaluated at all, Gate 9 hard stop included, while generatePWM went on applying the last steering override and throttle cap. It is folded into each loop's existing exit condition next to checkSerialQuit(), at a point where abandoning the command leaves nothing half-finished: ?compassheading, ?magtest, ?vescping, ?vescraw, ?gpsdiag, ?i2c, ?printbat, ?printtasks, ?printrssi, ?printpwm, ?printreceived, ?testbg and ?testpercent here, plus ?printcompass, ?compasscal and ?magalign in Compass.ino. Left with NO abort point of their own, and left that way DELIBERATELY: ?gpssetup (GPS.ino) and ?wifiupd (Common/SystemCommon.h). Each is one indivisible sequence whose halves are not separately valid - ?gpssetup raises the module baud, proves the link at the new rate, reverts to the old rate if the proof fails and then persists the result to the module's own NVM; ?wifiupd rewrites ~50 KB of web UI into SPIFFS and hash-verifies it afterwards - so stopping either one part-way leaves the GPS module or the stored web UI in a WORSE state than letting it run to the end. Everything else that blocks does have an abort point: ?gpscfg and ?gpsbaud (GPS.ino) and ?download and ?deleteallogs (Logger.ino) got theirs in this same change, alongside the list above. (2) ?i2c is now marked blocks_loop: 126 addresses against a 20 ms Wire timeout is up to ~2.5 s of frozen loop plus 126 i2cMutex acquisitions contending with generatePWM, the same class as ?gpscfg. (3) The BIND-button calibration LED now says WHICH outcome happened - 2 flashes full success, 3 flashes PARTIAL (iron calibration saved, mounting orientation NOT re-measured), nothing extra when the run saved nothing (runCompassCalibration() has already blinked its own 10-flash failure) - instead of blinking "success" whenever the compass chip was merely present. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - SAFETY: every BLOCKING bench command now refuses to run while Return-to-Me or Follow-Me is engaged. The rule is stated ONCE — rxRefuseIfEngaged() — and applied at the command-dispatch layer in checkSerial() (via the new blocks_loop flag on each kCommands row) and to the runtime BIND-button compass calibration in checkButtons(). Refused when engaged: ?compasscal, ?magalign, ?magtest, ?printcompass, ?compassheading, ?vescping, ?vescraw, ?gpsdiag, ?gpscfg, ?gpsbaud, ?gpssetup, ?printpwm, ?printrssi, ?printreceived, ?printtasks, ?printbat, ?testbg, ?testpercent, ?download, ?deleteallogs, ?wifiupd. Why: each of those holds the loop task for seconds-to-forever, and a frozen loop stops runRtmLoop()/runFmLoop() from evaluating ANY safety gate (Gate 9 hard stop included) while generatePWM keeps applying the last steering override and throttle cap. One-shot reads (?conf, ?diag, ?diagz, ?logstat, ?list, ?printgps, setters) are deliberately NOT gated — the rider must still be able to see what is happening. ?i2c was listed here when this line was first written and does NOT belong in it: a full 126-address bus scan against a 20 ms Wire timeout holds the loop for up to ~2.5 s, which is not a one-shot read by any useful measure. It is marked blocks_loop — refused at dispatch while engaged — and carries an abort point of its own; see item (2) of the line above. ?gpsdiag's own inline RTM-only guard is replaced by the shared gate, which additionally covers Follow-Me. No behaviour change when a command IS allowed to run. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 1 (GPS repair): cmdVescRaw() (?vescraw) now restores the UART mux to channel 1 (GPS) at the end of every iteration and again on function exit. Since STAGE 1 the mux RESTS on GPS and getGPSLoop() no longer switches it, so a command that calls setUartMux(0) and never restores would leave the GPS dark for the remainder of the session. Diagnostic command only — setUartMux() itself, the VESC query, the 200 ms listen window and every control path are unchanged. No confStruct change, SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 0 PART D (instrumentation only): added ?diag (one-shot, non-blocking snapshot of GPS bytes/sentences per second, fix age now/mean/max, COG timestamp-updates vs VALUE-changes, mux switches + read-back failures, VESC poll success rate, and loop min/mean/max) and ?diagz (zero the counters to bracket a run). Unlike ?gpsdiag these do not loop or delay, so they are safe to run with RTM/FM active and need no refusal guard. setUartMux() also gained two counter increments (switches, read-back mismatches) — the corrective re-write itself is unchanged. No control path, no confStruct change, SW_VERSION stays 34.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-19 - Rex hardening: cmdGpsDiag (?gpsdiag) refuses to run while RTM active — its ≤120s blocking loop would freeze runRtmLoop()/Phase A/B/convergence/Gate 9
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-19 - FM triage: cmdGpsDiag (?gpsdiag) — 2Hz GPS feed + RTM COG-valid sub-condition breakdown to diagnose why GPS COG heading never engages

// off. So "2 flashes = full success" and "3 flashes = PARTIAL" were 200 ms and 300 ms of 10 Hz
// flicker - a 100 ms difference at a rate near where flashes start to fuse. A human reliably
// counts discrete flashes to about 4-5 Hz; 10 Hz is not countable in the field. The rider would
// have had to be staring at the LED already knowing it was about to fire.
//
// That is not cosmetic. The PARTIAL result exists SPECIFICALLY so a rider who re-mounted the
// module and walked a sloppy circle is not told "success" while mag_orientation still holds the
// OLD angle. On the BIND-button path the LED is the only channel there is - nobody reads a
// serial terminal while walking a buggy round a car park - so the one distinction the feature
// was built to make was the one the LED could not carry.
//
// THE FIX IS ON-TIME, NOT COUNT. Counting needs the start to be caught and discrete events
// tracked. How long the lamp stays LIT is perceived instantly and needs no counting: 70 ms

// What it does:
//   Exactly the test rxRefuseIfEngaged() makes, meant to be used as a loop-exit condition inside
//   a blocking bench command that is ALREADY running. Returns true - after printing the standard
//   refusal plus one line saying the command is being stopped part-way - when Return-to-Me or
//   Follow-Me has become engaged since the command started. Returns false, silently, otherwise.
//
// Why it exists:
//   rxRefuseIfEngaged() is asked once, at dispatch. That closes the front door only.
//   rtm_rx_active / fm_rx_active are set from the triggeredReceive task when an arm packet
//   arrives, so they can turn true at any instant - including the instant after a bench command
//   was correctly allowed to start on an idle buggy. Without this second question, starting
//   ?magtest on the bench and then arming RTM from the remote to watch the display bought about
//   120 seconds in which NO safety gate was evaluated at all: no Gate 9 stop-distance hard stop,
//   no Phase A/B, no Phase C convergence - while generatePWM carried on applying the last
//   steering override and the last throttle cap. That is the exact hazard the dispatch gate was
//   written to remove, surviving through the back door. This closes it.
//
// Where to call it:
//   In the exit condition of a blocking command's loop, beside checkSerialQuit(), at a point
//   where walking away leaves nothing half-finished. It is deliberately cheap - two atomic loads
//   and nothing else - so it is fine in a 10 ms loop; it only prints on the way out, and it
//   never delays.
//
// Inputs:  what - the command being abandoned, printed verbatim (e.g. "?magtest").
// Outputs: refusal text on Serial when engaged; nothing at all otherwise.
// Side effects: none. It does NOT tidy up on the caller's behalf - each caller is responsible for
//   its own state (?vescraw puts the UART mux back on the GPS, ?compasscal aborts before it has
//   written a single byte of calibration). Deliberately NOT static: Compass.ino calls it too.

// ============================================================
//
// What it does:
//   Bypasses the normal getVescLoop() pipeline entirely. Manually switches
//   the UART mux to channel 0 (VESC), sends a raw COMM_GET_VALUES short-frame
//   query, then dumps every byte received in hex for up to 200ms. Repeats
//   every 2 seconds for 15 iterations (30 seconds total).
//
//   This probes the physical UART path rather than the parsed struct, so it
//   reveals whether the VESC is reachable at the hardware level independently
//   of whether getVescLoop() parses the response correctly.
//
// Inputs:  params - unused
// Outputs: hex dump to Serial; no struct writes; no global state changes
// Side effects: switches UART mux to channel 0 each iteration (same as normal VESC operation),
//               then returns it to channel 1 (GPS) — see the STAGE 1 note at each call site.
//
// How to interpret output:
//   Zero bytes every iteration    -> VESC unreachable. Check mux IC channel 0,
//                                    VESC TX wire, and GND connection.
//   Bytes received, no 0x02 lead  -> Baud rate mismatch. Firmware uses 115200;
//                                    check VESC Tool App Configuration -> General -> UART Baud.
//   Response starts with 0x02     -> VESC is alive and responding. The issue
//                                    is in receiveFromVESC() parsing, not hardware.

//
// What it does:
//   Streams one diagnostic line at 2 Hz for up to 120 seconds showing the RX GPS
//   feed state AND the exact values the RTM heading ladder (getRtmHeading() in
//   RTMState.ino) reads when it decides whether GPS course-over-ground (COG) is a
//   valid heading source. This answers the open field question from the Fable audit:
//   why does rtm_source=1 (GPS COG) never engage?
//
//   Each line reports, in order:
//     loc/date/time fix validity, satellites, HDOP,
//     chars/sentences/checksum counters (NMEA parse health),
//     raw gps.speed.kmph() vs the captured gps_last_speed_kmh that RTM actually reads,
//     the COG value + its age (ms) + the RX fix age (ms),
//     and a PASS/FAIL breakdown of the four cog_valid sub-conditions used by
//     getRtmHeading(): course captured, course in range, age < 1500ms,
//     speed >= rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh. Also prints gps_rejected + suspect count.
//
//   Reading the [cap rng fresh spd>=N] flags tells you WHICH condition blocks COG:
//     spd=0  -> speed never reaches the threshold (COG stays gated at low speed), OR
//              gps_last_speed_kmh is not propagating from the parser.
//     fresh=0-> course is captured but stale (>1.5s) — parse rate or mux starvation.
//     cap=0  -> course never captured at all — module not emitting RMC/VTG course.
//
// How to invoke:
//   Type '?gpsdiag' in a serial terminal (or the web-UI quick-commands dropdown).
//   Drive the buggy above rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh while watching COG_VALID flip to YES.
