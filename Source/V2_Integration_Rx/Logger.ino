// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-27 - Level-4 records now copy the controller-published 13-byte heading-evidence audit after the 83-byte FM block. CSV exposes the configured ladder mode, signed compass/COG gap, set/clear dwell progress, last-good/snapshot ages and raw COG/snapshot/comparison flags. 65-byte and 83-byte historical Deep records remain readable through record_size. Instrumentation only; no control/config/packet/SW_VERSION change.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-27 - Log mirror follows the GPS-only disagreement degradation: a per-tick compass-vs-COG disagreement no longer vetoes valid COG, so rtm_source/confidence report GPS_COG 1/3 while the controller uses it. The persistent latch still excludes only compass branches; held COG remains 1/2. Read-only mirror change, no record/packet/config/SW_VERSION change.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-27 - Level-4 logs now append an 18-byte Follow-Me engage-audit snapshot: exact mode/state/block reason, cap, radial distance/effective D_engage, rider speed, separation-dwell progress, F4 angle and every relevant gate bit. The snapshot is published by runFmLoop(), not recomputed here, so logging cannot disagree with or mutate the controller. New Deep records are 83 bytes; their first 65 bytes remain byte-identical to the old Deep layout. Header selection and row formatting use the file's stored record_size, so existing 65-byte logs still export with their original 35-column CSV while new files export the FM columns. The 8-byte BRLG header layout and format version are unchanged; no confStruct/SW_VERSION change.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - CRITICAL MAINTENANCE contract honoured again, same day, because the controller moved again (log mirror only): a standing heading-disagreement latch no longer just withdraws the compass, it drops the WHOLE ladder to the mode-0 path — GPS course only — so getRtmHeading() now returns NONE below rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh instead of serving a held COG, and returns NONE in mode 2 instead of serving the live compass. Two branches of this duplicate had to follow or the CSV would contradict the controller in exactly the state a rider would be reporting: (1) the COG-HOLD branch is now gated on !headingDisagreeLatched(), so a degraded tick logs src 0 / conf 0 rather than claiming a held GPS course the controller did not serve; (2) the mode-2 branch is gated the same way, so a diagnostic-mode session whose compass has been proven wrong logs NONE rather than src 3 / conf 2 COMPASS_LIVE. The compass-snapshot branch keeps the gate it was given this morning. Everything else about the mirror is unchanged, and the ORDER still matches the controller exactly: disagreement veto, live COG, held COG, compass snapshot. STRICTLY READ-ONLY: two more calls to the same read-only accessor from loggerTask, no controller state written, no timing changed. NO new column, no new rtm_source value, no record-size change — existing logs stay parseable. No confStruct change, no VescLogData change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - CRITICAL MAINTENANCE contract honoured again (log mirror only): convertToLogData()'s duplicate heading ladder now reads the heading-disagreement LATCH, not just the per-tick verdict. getRtmHeading() withdraws the compass fallback entirely once the compass has been caught disagreeing with GPS course for kHeadingDisagreeMs and returns NONE, but this mirror kept falling through to the compass branch and logging rtm_source = 2 / rtm_confidence = 2 on those ticks — the CSV asserted a compass heading at MEDIUM confidence for ticks on which the controller had refused the compass and was holding straight. That was unreachable in an RTM run until the latch clears became edge-triggered; it is reachable now, so the log would actively lie about the heading source in exactly the new refusal case a rider will report. The compass-snapshot branch is gated on !headingDisagreeLatched(), positioned exactly where the controller checks it — BELOW the last-good-COG hold (a held COG is still logged src 1 / conf 2 while the fault stands, since a held GPS course is not the sensor under suspicion) and ABOVE the compass fallback — so a gated tick falls out of the else-if chain as src 0 / conf 0 = NONE, the pair getRtmHeading() actually returns. Strictly READ-ONLY: one call to a read-only accessor from loggerTask, no controller state written, no timing changed. NO new column, no new rtm_source value, no record-size change — existing logs stay parseable. No confStruct change, no VescLogData change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - MID-RUN ABORT for ?download and ?deleteallogs, plus the MISSING WATCHDOG FEED in deleteAllLogFiles(). Both commands now ask rxAbortIfEngaged() inside their per-item loop, so an RTM/FM engagement that begins AFTER the command started stops it instead of freezing every safety gate for the rest of it — on ?download that was MINUTES (the code's own note records ~3 min for a ~350 kB file), which is by far the largest blind spot of any command on this board. ?download checks at the RECORD boundary, so no half-formatted row reaches the wire, closes the file on the way out, and prints a DIFFERENT end-of-transfer marker: "=== END CSV DATA ===" is never printed after an abort, because every reader treats that line as "the whole file arrived" and printing it over a truncated stream would silently pass a partial log off as complete; the abort marker names itself and carries the record count actually sent. ?deleteallogs checks at the WHOLE-FILE boundary before each SPIFFS.remove(), so every file is either fully deleted or fully untouched, and it now reports how many were ACTUALLY deleted instead of claiming completion over a partial run. Separately, its loop gained the watchdog feed it never had: initWatchdog() now arms the 3000 ms panic WDT on the first boot after a version bump where it previously did not, and on a full SPIFFS the garbage collection each remove() triggers can walk the loop past the timeout and panic-reboot mid-delete. The feed is gated on g_wdt_active, the same guard PWM.ino and Radio.ino use. NO change to the log file format, record layout or column set — existing logs stay parseable — and no change to either command's behaviour or timing when it runs to completion. No confStruct change, no VescLogData change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-16 - CRITICAL MAINTENANCE contract honoured (log mirror only; no new column, no new rtm_source value, no record-size change, no control path touched): the 2026-08-16 COG-hold change was mirrored into convertToLogData()'s STAGE 2 guards but NOT into the hold itself, so on every tick the controller was serving the last good COG (confidence 2, up to kCogHoldMs after cog_valid drops) the log recorded COMPASS_SNAPSHOT or NONE instead — the rtm_source / rtm_confidence columns misdescribed the exact source transitions these logs are being read to diagnose. The duplicate ladder now re-serves cog_last_good_deg / cog_last_good_ms in the same position and on the same terms the controller does (after the disagreement veto and the live-COG branch, gated on mode 1 and !cog_frozen_moving, ahead of the compass fallback) and logs it as src 1 / conf 2 — GPS_COG at MEDIUM, the pair getRtmHeading() actually returns, so held and live COG stay distinguishable without touching the CSV format. Strictly READ-ONLY: this mirror runs in loggerTask and writes no controller state, no timing, nothing. The 5 s escalation latch is still deliberately not read here. No confStruct change, no VescLogData change, sizeof stays 192, SW_VERSION stays 35.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 2 (log mirror only, no new column, no record-size change): the inline getRtmHeading() duplicate in convertToLogData() now applies the same two heading-trust guards RTMState.ino gained — guard 1 (COG rejected when its VALUE has been frozen longer than kRtmCogFrozenMs while gps_last_speed_kmh >= rtm_cog_min_speed_kmh, and no compass promotion in that state) and guard 2 (per-tick COG-vs-compass-snapshot disagreement beyond kHeadingDisagreeDeg = no source at all). Without this, rtm_source/rtm_confidence would keep logging "GPS COG, HIGH" for ticks where the controller was actually holding straight, which is precisely the blindness Stage 0 was built to end. The 5 s escalation latch is deliberately NOT read here: this runs in loggerTask and the mirror stays side-effect-free and per-tick. No confStruct change, no VescLogData change, sizeof stays 184, SW_VERSION stays 34, no control path touched.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-25 - STAGE 0 PART B+C (instrumentation only): every log file now opens with an 8-byte self-describing header (magic "BRLG", format version, log level, record size) so a reader can parse a VARIABLE record size instead of assuming sizeof(VescLogData); the level is latched once per FILE in createNewLogFile() so changing the setting mid-session cannot corrupt an open file; that revision's level 4 wrote the now-legacy 65-byte record (59-byte level-3 record + gps_sent_per_s, cog_frozen_s, mux_err_cnt, loop_max_ms); ?download reads the header, steps by header.record_size, refuses a file with no valid magic in plain English instead of emitting garbage, and formats rows through the single shared logFormatCsvRow() that the WiFi path also calls — so the two CSV outputs cannot drift apart again. No confStruct change, sizeof stays 184, SW_VERSION stays 34, no control path touched.
