// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-17 - defaultConf.rtm_double_squeeze_en 0 → 1: the factory default RTM arm gesture is now the
//   deliberate double squeeze, which is what the struct comment always documented. Default value + comments only —
//   confStruct UNCHANGED, sizeof stays 136, SW_VERSION stays 27, no SPIFFS reset, and units with a stored value keep it.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - BLE re-enable deep-fix (Rex 2026-07-20-bremote-fw-audit-tx-ble-reenable-rootcause):
//   BLE_ENABLED turned back ON permanently with the single-core coexistence hardening applied —
//   heap-floor guard on init, relaxed connection interval, consolidated/back-pressured notify stream
//   moved off loop() into a dedicated task, an i2cMutex serializing the shared HT16K33+ADS1115 Wire bus,
//   and a WiFi-vs-BLE mutual-exclusion gate. Runtime/task/init changes only — confStruct UNCHANGED,
//   sizeof stays 136, SW_VERSION stays 27, no SPIFFS reset. Re-commenting #define BLE_ENABLED (below) is
//   still the instant, proven rollback.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - MagGesture: SW_VERSION 26 → 27; sizeof(confStruct) 132 → 136 (2 bytes are alignment tail padding).
//   New TX field mag_mode (uint16_t, 0-3, default 0 = off / Hall sensor not fitted) selects what the
//   magnet gesture arms: 1=FM (2s), 2=RTM (2s), 3=FM (2s) + RTM (5s). magGestureRole() + MAG_ROLE_*
//   defines added. bt_enabled is UNCHANGED (still 0-2) — BLE and the optional Hall sensor are
//   separate concerns and get separate fields.
//   ⚠ SW_VERSION bump RESETS the TX SPIFFS config to defaultConf on first flash.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - SW27 defaults bake: defaultConf carries the factory default
//   configuration — pairing unbound, calibration nominal, GPS/speed source and RTM/FM tuning
//   at generic defaults. fm_arm_window_s is baked at 180 (see the rationale comment at the
//   field). No struct change: sizeof(confStruct) stays 136 and SW_VERSION stays 27.
//
// ============================================================
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - defaultConf.mag_mode ships at 0 (magnet gesture off). This is the
// safe general default: not every remote has the DRV5032 Hall sensor + magnet fitted, and
// P_MAG (GPIO 9) reads an UNDEFINED state without it, which would let the magnet gesture
// mis-fire on hardware that was never meant to use it. Enable 1/2/3 per device via the web UI.
// ============================================================
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-27 - F4 angle is now advisory-only. fm_flags bit 4 reports the RX Schmitt warning; while armed with a healthy link the TX emits one short Pattern 5 pulse immediately and every 3 s until the warning clears. No struct/packet/config change; SW_VERSION stays 27.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - Batch T (FM v1.4): TelemetryPacket index 16 reserved_tx_imu repurposed as fm_flags
//   ([0]armed [1]engaged [2]armed-not-ready [3]fault-stop-sticky; bit 4 added 2026-08-27) + FM_FLAG_* / FM_LINK_HEALTHY_MS defines.
//   No struct size change (byte already present), no confStruct change — sizeof(confStruct) stays 136,
//   SW_VERSION stays 27, static_assert intact, SPIFFS config NOT reset by this flash.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW50: DISPLAY_MODE_AMP replaces INTBAT; TelemetryPacket +foil_motor_amps byte (index 6); link_quality→index 7
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW48: DISP_LOCK/UNLOCK macros; mutex all bare display callers outside renderOperationalDisplay/updateBargraphs
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW46: DISPLAY_MODE order — Temp(0)/Thr(1)/Speed(2)/Power(3)/Bat(4)/IntBat(5); THR centre, LEFT=Temp, RIGHT=Speed
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW33: GPIO 9 repurposed as P_MAG digital Hall sensor (DRV5032FADBZR); removed from serialOff OUTPUT-LOW block; mag_seen_high boot guard added
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW33b: BT dot test (C7 R1) driven by P_MAG Hall sensor; bt_dot_state + BT_DOT_* defines added
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-21 - Added TinyGPS++ include, gps_tx + tx_gps_speed globals, and P_U1_RX/P_U1_TX pin defines for TX GPS (BN-220 on Serial1)
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-22 - Fixed speed_src/volatile comments; defaults gps_en=0,speed_src=0; added gps_max_hdop field (HDOP*100, tail-padding slot, sizeof stays 92)
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-22 - Added gps_chip_type field (GPS module selector: 0=BN-220, 2=M10); sizeof 92→96
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-25 - P7: Added RTM meta-packet queue globals (rtm_meta_type/value/count) and RTM throttle cap (rtm_thr_cap_tx, rtm_tx_active)
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-27 - P8: Added rtm_display_mode, fm_warn_distance_m, rtm_steer_exit_on_input to confStruct; TelemetryPacket adds rtm_distance at index 5; rtm_max_runtime_s default 120→0
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-27 - P8.1: Added fm_arm_window_s to confStruct; FM redesigned as arm/disarm toggle with mode memory; sizeof 124→128
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-28 - P9: Added dist_unit (fills 2-byte tail padding; sizeof stays 128); rtm_arm_dist_m RAM global
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-04-29 - Sleep: added sleep_timeout_s to confStruct; SW_VERSION 25→26
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-01 - Release: DEBUG_RX commented out for production build
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-01 - thr_expo1 repurposed as fm_display_mode (FM digit zone data selector, 1-4)
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-08-15 - Comments in this firmware no longer say "Core 0" / "Core 1". The ESP32-C3 is SINGLE-CORE:
//                          every xTaskCreatePinnedToCore() call here passes core 0, and there is no core 1 to pin to.
//                          The races these mutexes and atomics guard are TASK PREEMPTION on one core, not parallel
//                          execution on two — same hazard, different mechanism, and the old wording taught the wrong
//                          model. Actors are now named by task ("the loop task", "the sendData task") instead. The RX
//                          was corrected this way on 2026-05-12; the TX kept the stale wording until now.
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-02 - Added displayMutex SemaphoreHandle_t (displayBuffer race between the loop task and the bargraph task)
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW32 M3: rtm_meta_type/value/count + rtm_thr_cap_tx + rtm_tx_active changed volatile→std::atomic<T>; release/acquire ordering in queue/consumer
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-13 - SW32: default display_mode changed 0→DISPLAY_MODE_THR (throttle % as boot display; field test feedback)
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-05-09 - Bundle 9-Final: Added USB CDC On Boot compile-time guard
// V2.5-Evo - 2026-07-20 - T2: fm_arm_window_s comment corrected 10-60s → 10-600s (validation range was already 10-600; comment was stale). No struct change.
