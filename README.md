ESP32 LoRa wireless remote for efoil and RC tow buggy — 868/915 MHz, 10 Hz control cycle, VESC UART telemetry, GPS speed display, integrated data logger.

**Status: Alpha — BLE + VESC Tool field-confirmed ✅ (2026-05-16). Follow-Me including FM_RETURN implemented; water validation pending.**

> **⚠️ 2026-07-25 — important fix, please reflash both boards.** A bug was found in on-water testing: the shared serial line was prioritising the VESC over the GPS, so the receiver was catching only ~2% of the GPS feed and Follow-Me could steer on a dead heading. Priority is now swapped and the GPS course works. **Fixed but not yet proven on the water** — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Read the Alpha Testing Notes below before any in-water use.**

## 🚀 New here? Start with the setup guide

### **[→ Zero → Foiling — the complete setup walkthrough](docs/ZERO_TO_FOILING.md)**

**Out of the box to on the water, in one linear path.** Flashing, TX calibration, pairing, compass
calibration, VESC/PPM wiring and setup, the wheels-up safety check, web-portal configuration, the dry
arming test, and your first Follow-Me session. If you are setting up a BREmote for the first time,
**read that guide, not this page.**

This README is the reference: what the hardware is, what changed in each version, what every setting
and status code means, and what is still broken. Come back to it once you are running.

📁 **[Browse all the detailed guides in `docs/` →](docs/)** — wiring, flashing, GPS, compass, VESC
tuning, display reference and more. The [index below](#-detailed-guides--where-to-go-deeper) says

## Contributors

People who have tested, reported, or contributed code to **this fork** specifically. Upstream credit
for the original hardware and firmware is in [Credits](#credits) below.

| | |
|---|---|
| **[robertzach](https://github.com/robertzach)** *(heiguga)* | First outside contributor. Brought **HGLRC M100-5883** support — his [PR #1](https://github.com/monterman/BREmote-V2/pull/1) identified that the module carries a **QMC5883P at 0x2C**, not the QMC5883L the firmware assumed, and his working implementation read from register `0x01`. That independently confirmed the QST datasheet against ArduPilot's driver, which has that init write transposed — so his code was the tiebreaker on a real ambiguity. Also field-tested the dual-compass build within hours of release, and hit the Sea-model altitude ceiling at 550 m, which is why `gps_dyn_model` exists. |

## Credits

BREmote is a collaborative open-source project built by the efoil and esk8 community:

| Contributor | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **[LudwigBre / Luddi96](https://github.com/Luddi96/BREmote)** | **Original hardware design, original firmware architecture, project founder, and dev-logger framework (dev-logger branch). All core features originate here.** |
| **Janrusher** | Dynamic throttle cap mode and Web Console foundation — significant V2 enhancements forked from LudwigBre, further refined in V2.5-Evo |
| **monterman** | V2.5-Evo firmware: TX GPS implementation, dev-logger AUX button toggle with LED status feedback (5× flash = start, 2× flash = stop), date format DDMMYY → MMDDYY, web console major rebuild (upload/download/compare JSON, integrated serial console, TX+RX coverage, plain-English parameter docs for every setting), deep codebase analysis, critical bug documentation, RTM/FM mode design, VESC UART telemetry diagnosis and root-cause fix (SW55), DISPLAY_MODE_INTBAT 7th display mode, BT status dot + Hall sensor activation framework, BLE NUS + VESC Tool binary protocol live gauges (field-confirmed 2026-05-16) |

This fork exists because LudwigBre published open hardware and firmware under GPL 3.0. V2.5-Evo enhancements are released under the same license and dedicated back to the community.

### Branches — read this before you clone

| Branch | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`master`** | **V2.5-Evo. The default branch, and what you want.** Hardware-verified on both boards. |
| `ludwig-upstream-main` | **LudwigBre's original line, not mine.** Kept so upstream changes can be tracked and merged. Do not flash it expecting V2.5-Evo behaviour — it is a different firmware. |
| `multi-tx` | Work in progress: multiple remotes sharing one buggy. **Nothing here has been flashed to hardware.** |

`ludwig-upstream-main` was called `main` until 2026-08-05. It was renamed because "main" reads
like the primary branch of *this* repo, which it is not — it is a mirror of
[Luddi96/BREmote](https://github.com/Luddi96/BREmote), whose own default branch is `main`. The
old name caused exactly the confusion the new one avoids.

## What Is This?

BREmote is a custom wireless remote system for efoils and RC tow buggies. The TX (handheld) sends throttle and steering over LoRa at 10 Hz. The RX (mounted on the vehicle) drives the ESC/VESC and returns telemetry.

## Hardware Requirements

> 📖 Wiring the GPS + compass: [BN-880 → RX guide](docs/GPS_Wiring_BN880_RX.md). Fitting the magnet: [Hall sensor tutorial](docs/Hall_Sensor_Install_Tutorial.md).

| Component | TX (Handheld) | RX (Board Unit) |
|---|---|---|
| MCU | ESP32-C3 | ESP32-C3 |
| Module | HT-CT62 (ESP32-C3 + SX1262 + WiFi + **BLE** integrated) | HT-CT62 |
| Radio | SX1262 LoRa | SX1262 LoRa |
| BLE | Built-in (ESP32-C3) — NUS + VESC Tool protocol ✅ in master; `bt_enabled` SPIFFS config (0=off, 1=Hall-mode, 2=always-on) | Built-in (ESP32-C3) — RX BLE planned |
| GPS | BN-220 or [HGLRC M100 Mini](https://www.hglrc.com/products/hglrc-m100_mini-gps) (M10 chip, no compass, 3.3V–5V) | BN-880 or [HGLRC M100-5883](https://www.hglrc.com/products/m100-5883-gps) (M10 chip + compass) |
| Compass | None | QMC5883L (I2C `0x0D`) **or** QMC5883P (I2C `0x2C`) — auto-detected at boot |
| Display | HT16K33 dot matrix (I2C 0x70) | None |
| ADC | ADS1115 (I2C 0x48) | None |
| I/O Expander | None | AW9523 (I2C) |
| ESC / VESC | None | VESC UART or PWM (RMT GPIO 9) |

> ⚠️ **TX GPS must be 3.3V tolerant** — the ESP32-C3 supplies 3.3V only. Both the BN-220 and HGLRC M100 Mini meet this requirement.

> 🔌 **Wiring the RX GPS + compass:** **[BN-880 → RX wiring guide →](docs/GPS_Wiring_BN880_RX.md)** — six wires,
> pin map, and the three things that bite: every wire runs **straight, label to label** (the PCB does the UART
> crossover for you), the BN-880 needs **5 V**, and `gps_chip_type` must be set to your module.

---

## Quick Start

> 🚀 **Setting up for the first time? Follow [Zero → Foiling](docs/ZERO_TO_FOILING.md) instead** — it covers the same ground in order, with the VESC/PPM and safety steps this summary skips.

> ⚠️ **`master` ships SAFE factory defaults — unbound and uncalibrated** (no pairing, neutral compass/throttle calibration). After flashing you **must** set up your own devices: pair TX↔RX, run TX calibration (hold LEFT toggle at boot), and run `?compasscal` on RX. Until you do, the remote won't respond correctly to your throttle or compass.

1. **Flash firmware** — easiest is a prebuilt `.bin`, no toolchain needed (see below).

   **🟢 Simple — flash a prebuilt `.bin` (recommended, no compiling)**

   Ready-to-flash binaries live next to their source, with a README in each folder explaining
   which build is which:

   | Board | Folder |
   |---|---|
   | TX | **[`Source/V2_Integration_Tx/TX firmware/`](Source/V2_Integration_Tx/TX%20firmware/)** |
   | RX | **[`Source/V2_Integration_Rx/RX firmware/`](Source/V2_Integration_Rx/RX%20firmware/)** |

   > 🚨 **Download the RAW file — this is where people go wrong.** Click the `.bin` on GitHub, then
   > use the **Download raw file** button (⤓, top-right of the file view). Do **not** use your
   > browser's *Save Page As* — that saves an HTML page with a `.bin` name, which will not flash and
   > looks like a dead board. Or clone the repo and take it from the folder:
   > `git clone https://github.com/monterman/BREmote-V2.git`
   >
   > **Sanity check:** a real image is a few hundred KB. A few KB, or something that opens as a web
   > page in a text editor, means you saved the HTML.

   Download the `.bin` you want, then use **either**:

   - ⭐ **[Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools)**
     (Espressif's Windows GUI — also called the ESP Download Tool) — **the recommended way.**
     🎥 **[Ludwig demonstrates it from 40:00](https://youtu.be/r6JIZEq3aTU?t=2400)**.
     Chip `ESP32-C3`, load the `.bin` at address **`0x10000`**, press START.
     **[Full step-by-step guide →](docs/FLASHING_WITH_DOWNLOAD_TOOL.md)**
   - **esptool** (any OS, one line):
     ```bash
     esptool --chip esp32c3 --port COM<N> write-flash 0x10000 <the-file>.bin
     ```

   > **`0x10000` is the address that matters.** These are app-only images, so the *flash itself*
   > never touches the partition table or SPIFFS.
   >
   > ⚠️ **That does not mean your settings always survive.** On boot the firmware compares the
   > stored config version against its own and **rewrites config to defaults when they differ**
   > (`Common/SPIFFSEngine.h`). So flashing a build with a **different `SW_VERSION`** wipes your
   > pairing, calibration and settings even though the flash left SPIFFS alone — and rolling back,
   > then coming forward again, wipes it twice. Same version in, same version out = settings kept.
   > **[Back up first →](#-backing-up-your-settings--read-this-before-you-flash)**
   >
   > Identify the board by MAC (`esptool --chip esp32c3 --port COM<N> read-mac`) rather than by
   > COM number: TX and RX are the same chip and COM numbers move between reboots.

   ⚙️ **Compiling it yourself? (advanced)** Follow the per-board guides — the partition settings
   **differ between TX and RX**, and the wrong one wipes config:
   **[RX flashing guide →](docs/FLASHING_RX_ARDUINO.md)** · **[TX flashing guide →](docs/FLASHING_TX_ARDUINO.md)**
2. **Power on both TX and RX** — TX shows `EP` (not paired) on first boot
3. **Pair** — hold RIGHT toggle on TX at boot; hold BIND on RX at boot simultaneously
4. **Connect to WiFi AP** — SSID shown on the device; default password `12345678` *(power off the other device first — see WiFi note below)*
5. **Open the Web Serial Config Tool** — configure all parameters with plain English labels
6. **Calibrate TX** — hold LEFT toggle at boot, follow the display prompts
7. **Calibrate RX compass** — **first check the module is mounted square to the buggy** (lined up with the nose, or turned exactly 90° / 180° / 270° from it — **not diagonal**; the firmware stores only those four values, so a module at 30° is stored as 0° and keeps 30° of error no calibration can remove). Then **point the nose of the buggy at NORTH** and run `?compasscal` (RX serial at 115200 baud, or short-press BIND) and **turn it slowly CLOCKWISE through two full circles, finishing back on north.** One run sets the iron calibration, the mounting handedness and the mounting orientation. **BIND LED: 2 blinks = full success. 3 blinks = PARTIAL** — the iron calibration saved but the mounting orientation did not, so walk it again. Full procedure: **[Zero → Foiling § 2.4](docs/ZERO_TO_FOILING.md#24-compass-calibration-rx--nose-on-north-two-clockwise-circles)**

## 🛠️ Web Configuration Interfaces

BREmote V2.5-Evo has three separate web configuration interfaces:

> ⚠️ **WiFi turns off automatically when TX and RX are paired and in range.** LoRa takes precedence over WiFi. To access the web UI on either device, make sure the **other device is powered off** — otherwise the LoRa link forms, WiFi shuts down, and you cannot connect. Once you have finished configuring, power the other device back on.

### 1. TX Embedded Web Page
Served by the TX WiFi AP for the first 120 seconds after boot. Connect to the TX WiFi AP and open the device IP in any browser. Configures all TX SPIFFS parameters with valid range hints.

### 2. RX Embedded Web Page
Served by the RX WiFi AP for the first 120 seconds after boot. Configures all RX SPIFFS parameters and provides log file management (list, download, delete).

### 3. BREmote V2.5-Evo — Web Serial Config Tool *(standalone, offline)*

The most capable interface. Connects to TX or RX via USB serial (requires Chrome or Edge).

**Open directly — no download needed:**
[https://monterman.github.io/BREmote-V2/BREmote_V2.5-Evo_Web_Serial_Config_Tool.html](https://monterman.github.io/BREmote-V2/BREmote_V2.5-Evo_Web_Serial_Config_Tool.html)

**Or download for fully offline use:** [`docs/BREmote_V2.5-Evo_Web_Serial_Config_Tool.html`](docs/BREmote_V2.5-Evo_Web_Serial_Config_Tool.html)

**What it does:**
- Configure both TX and RX — switch between boards without leaving the page
- Upload / download / compare two configurations side by side
- Integrated serial console with custom commands dropdown
- Extensive plain-English descriptions for every parameter — you know what each setting does and its valid range before you change it
- Export config as **JSON** or **Base64** (for serial paste)
- Log file download and management
- Dirty-state highlighting — changed fields highlighted until saved
- Works fully offline after download

### 💾 Backing up your settings — read this before you flash

Flashing a build with a different config version **resets every setting to defaults**. Back up first,
and know which format to use:

| Format | Use it for | Survives a firmware update? |
|---|---|---|
| **Base64** ✅ | **Backup / restore across firmware versions** | **Yes** — raw copy of the config block, restores as-is |
| **JSON** | Reading, editing, diffing, sharing settings with someone | **Not always** — see below |

> ⚠️ **Use Base64 for backups.** JSON is keyed by field *name*, so if a setting was renamed or
> replaced between versions, the import is **rejected as an unknown field** and you lose the restore.
> Base64 is a straight copy of the config block and does not care what the fields are called.
>
> JSON is still the better format when you want to *read* your settings, compare two boards, or send
> a config to someone for troubleshooting — just don't rely on it as your only backup.

**Recommended before any flash:**
1. Connect the board in the Web Serial Config Tool
2. Export **Base64** — keep it (this is the restore file)
3. Export **JSON** as well — human-readable reference if you ever need to rebuild by hand
4. Flash, then paste the Base64 back and **`?save`**
5. **Re-run calibration anyway** — `?compasscal` on RX, LEFT-toggle calibration on TX. Stored
   calibration is only as good as the mounting it was taken in.

## TX Features

### Standard Features (V2)

- Hall-effect throttle with calibration
- Hall-effect toggle for steering and gear/menu input
- Dot matrix display showing telemetry modes
- LoRa packet transmission at 10 Hz
- Gears mode, no-gears mode, dynamic throttle cap mode
- Configurable throttle expo curve
- System lock / unlock sequence
- Vibration motor feedback
- Internal battery voltage monitoring
- USB charging detection and display
- Pairing with address-based authentication

### V2.5-Evo: TX GPS Speed Display

The **SP** (Speed) telemetry display mode can now read speed directly from the TX GPS module (BN-220 on Serial1), eliminating dependence on the LoRa telemetry round-trip. Configure `speed_src` in Config Studio or the web UI:

| `speed_src` | Source | Unit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | RX GPS | km/h | V2 original |
| 1 | RX GPS | knots | V2 original |
| 2 | TX GPS | km/h | ✅ V2.5-Evo |
| 3 | TX GPS | knots | ✅ V2.5-Evo |
| 4 | RX GPS | mph | ✅ V2.5-Evo |
| 5 | TX GPS | mph | ✅ V2.5-Evo |

Display shows `--` when no fix is available or the fix is older than the configured stale timeout. Set `gps_en = 1` and reboot after changing it.

#### GPS — V2.5-Evo (2026-07-31)

Every GPS config write is now acknowledgement-verified, and the firmware auto-detects whether
your module speaks the u-blox 6/7/8 or the M9/M10 dialect — so a BN-220, BN-880 or M10 all
self-configure from one image. 📖 **[`docs/GPS.md`](docs/GPS.md)** explains the design, why
`dynModel=Sea` matters (and the ⚠️ 500 m altitude caveat), and how to recover a GPS that has
stopped accepting commands.

Two things worth knowing up front:

- **Riding above ~500 m?** The Sea navigation model has a 500 m ceiling. On the RX that is a
  setting, not a recompile: `?set gps_dyn_model 4` then `?save` switches it to Automotive.
- **A GPS that shows nothing at all** is often a module that came off a flight controller —
  Betaflight leaves u-blox modules **UBX-only with NMEA output disabled**, saved in the module's
  own memory. The RX now recognises that during its listen-only baud scan and switches NMEA back
  on: flash the current RX firmware and run **`?gpssetup`**. This used to need u-center on a PC.

<details>
<summary>Older detail — wiring, commands and recovery steps</summary>

📖 **Wiring & troubleshooting: [`docs/hardware/gps-troubleshooting.md`](docs/hardware/gps-troubleshooting.md)**

**Fitting a new GPS?** Plug it in, power on, then run `?gpscfg` and check it reads
`dynModel : 5 (Sea)`. The firmware finds the module at whatever baud it ships on and
configures it — BN-220, BN-880, NEO-M8N, NEO-M9N and MAX-M10S all work from the same image,
with no chip-specific setting to declare.

Optionally run **`?gpssetup` once** per remote. It raises the module to 115200, applies every
setting with the acknowledgement checked, and writes the result to the **module's own flash**
so it survives a power cycle.

**Every UBX configuration write is now acknowledgement-verified.** Previously the firmware
sent configuration blind and could not tell a successful write from an ignored one — which is
how a receiver ended up running `dynModel 0 (Portable)` while the logs said `Sea`. Portable
permits 310 m/s horizontal and 50 m/s vertical solutions, and has been observed producing
254 km/h and 4800 m readings as *high-confidence* fixes. Boot now prints the outcome of each
write, and `?gpscfg` reads the setting back **out of the module** as an independent check.

🚨 **If the GPS reports position but rejects all configuration** — boot showing `no-ACK` on
every line, or `?gpsbaud` showing NMEA present but *"UBX input: DEAD"* — the module has
disabled its own UART receiver after accumulated framing errors.

> **Fix: unplug USB, then flip the power switch off. Wait 2 s, power back on.**
> Unplugging USB cuts power fully on both TX and RX; on the TX the switch also guarantees the
> internal cell is not still running the module. A reboot, a reset or a re-flash will **not**
> clear it — the GPS has to actually lose power, which is also why no serial command can fix
> it (the module has stopped listening). No re-flashing is required.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `?gpscfg` | Read `dynModel` back out of the module — proves what it is actually running |
| `?gpsbaud` | Listen-only baud scan; reports whether UBX input is alive |
| `?gpssetup` | One-time full setup, saved permanently into the module |
| `?gpsraw` | Raw NMEA dump when nothing else responds |

All are USB-only bench commands (the TX disables serial on a battery boot) and none affect the
LoRa link.

Unavailable modes (no VESC lock or no GPS fix) are skipped automatically. `MA` requires VESC telemetry; `SP` with RX GPS source requires GPS fix (TX GPS source always shows, using `--` when no fix).

**PV** shows VESC battery-side power in kW with one decimal (e.g., `4.4` = 4400 W). Capped at 9.9 kW.

### TX Toggle Button Reference — V2.5-Evo P8 Gestures

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Boot + hold LEFT toggle | Calibration mode |
| Boot + hold RIGHT toggle | Pairing mode |
| Boot + THR + LEFT toggle | Force BLE for session — activates BLE regardless of `bt_enabled` setting; display shows `bt`; persists until reboot |
| Boot + THR + RIGHT toggle | Delete SPIFFS config (factory reset) |
| LEFT hold 2 s | Lock the Remote; while FM is armed and the trigger is released: previous F1–F6 mode, repeating every 2 s |
| RIGHT hold 2 s | Cycle telemetry display mode; while FM is armed and the trigger is released: next F1–F6 mode, repeating every 2 s |
| RIGHT tap → LEFT hold | No autonomous action (former RTM gesture retired) |
| LEFT tap → RIGHT hold (default 3 s, tunable 3–10 s) | Cycle **Follow-Me** override mode (F0–F6) |

The armed LEFT/RIGHT selector wraps only through F1–F6; it never lands on F0. Release the trigger,
wait briefly for the steering-toggle block to clear, then hold the desired direction. F0/disarm
remains on the deliberate combo gesture.

## RX Features

### Standard Features (V2)

- VESC UART telemetry (battery %, FET temperature, speed, power)
- Single motor, differential motor, or servo steering output
- PWM output via RMT (GPIO 9) and AW9523 I/O expander
- Water ingress detection with safety stop
- Configurable failsafe time (motor stop on LoRa link loss)
- Foil battery cell count and voltage monitoring
- BMS detection
- GPS positioning (BN-880 or HGLRC M100-5883)
- Compass (I2C, fully calibrated) — **either a QMC5883L at `0x0D` (BN-880) or a QMC5883P at `0x2C` (HGLRC M100-5883), detected automatically at boot and driven by the matching driver**; one firmware image, nothing to set. FM/FM_RETURN uses GPS COG as primary heading and a compass snapshot as low-speed fallback; pure compass mode remains diagnostic only (`rtm_use_compass=2`, historical key)
- Kalman filter on GPS data
- Follow-me mode framework (positional modes: behind, near right, near left)
- WiFi AP for web configuration and log management

### V2.5-Evo: Data Logger *(framework by LudwigBre — AUX toggle by monterman)*

> **Leave `logger_en` at 0 — that is the recommended setting.** The RX then boots with logging off and
> never fills SPIFFS while parked or on the bench. **Short-press AUX whenever the RX is running to
> start logging (AUX LED blinks 5×), and short-press again to stop (2 blinks)** — logging per session,
> on demand. `logger_en=1` only means it starts recording the instant it powers up, moving or not.
> Seeing `logger_en=0` at boot is correct behaviour, not a fault.

The RX board logs GPS position, VESC telemetry, voltage, speed, and timestamps to on-board flash storage.

> **Keep `logger_en = 0` (the default).** Use the AUX button to start and stop individual logging sessions. If you set `logger_en = 1`, the logger starts automatically on every boot and logs continuously — not recommended, as it fills flash quickly and runs without GPS-lock confirmation.

**Starting and stopping a session:**

| Action | LED | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Press AUX once | 5× flash | Logging session started |
| Press AUX once again | 2× flash | Logging session stopped |

**Tips:**
- **Wait for GPS lock** before pressing AUX — entries without a valid fix record zero coordinates
- **WiFi auto-disables** while logging to reduce current draw and RF interference with GPS
- **Brownout warning:** the logger auto-stops if supply voltage drops below threshold; WiFi + logging together draw significant current — ensure adequate power supply
- **File format:** `MMDDYY_HHMMSS.csv` (UTC, US date order) *
- **Download:** Connect to RX WiFi AP → open the RX embedded web page or the Web Serial Config Tool → **Manage Logs** section
- **Log rate:** default **3 Hz**, tuned for propeller / max-speed testing. Raise to 5 Hz for RTM/steering analysis with `?lograte 5` over serial (resets to 3 Hz on reboot; not persisted). Record size, rate→duration table, and SPIFFS capacity: see `docs/LOGGER_NOTES.md`.

*\* Date format changed from DDMMYY (original LudwigBre) to MMDDYY in V2.5-Evo.*

## 🛡️ Safety Philosophy

> 📖 The full model, and why it is built this way: [BUGGY_FOIL_DOMAIN.md](BUGGY_FOIL_DOMAIN.md)

> **The Tow Buggy ONLY moves when the user physically holds the throttle trigger.**

This rule is non-negotiable and is enforced at the firmware level — it cannot be configured away:

- Autonomous assist modes can **only subtract from throttle** — they can never add to it
- Releasing the throttle trigger stops the buggy **immediately**, regardless of any active mode
- No loiter, no station-keeping, no position hold, no autonomous parking
- Follow-Me, including FM_RETURN, can adjust steering and reduce throttle — it cannot independently spin the motor
- Without active user throttle input, the buggy motor **never moves** under any circumstance

---

## FM_RETURN — Return after stopping

The former standalone Return-to-Me mode, gesture, TX state machine and 0xF1 control path are
retired. Return is now a state inside Follow-Me and uses the same declaration, fault gates,
steering controller and effective `fm_engage_dist_m`.

When an `FM_ACTIVE` rider remains below 2 km/h for 2 seconds, Follow-Me always enters `FM_RETURN`,
regardless of distance. Outside the effective engage radius it performs direct retrieval. At or
inside the radius it immediately completes to `FM_ARMED` without commanding return motion, using
the same cleanup for every latch and controller state. A stationary `FM_ARMED` declaration can
enter RETURN only outside the radius. The buggy remains stopped during the proof and moves only
while the trigger is held; release pauses a running return, and deliberate steering takes priority.

On arrival at `distance <= effective fm_engage_dist_m`, the RX stops first, clears the separation
latch and enters `FM_ARMED`. The TX stays armed and keeps the selected F1–F6 declaration alive;
automatic Follow-Me cannot resume until a fresh 2-second radial proof above the engagement distance.
If the trigger is still held, cap 0 remains until it is released once; otherwise manual cap 255 is
available immediately. Sustained rider motion also cancels return to `FM_ARMED`, never directly to
`FM_ACTIVE`. The TX shows `rE` only while return is active. The historical RX config keys
`rtm_target_speed_kmh`, `rtm_align_threshold_deg`, and `rtm_approach_zone_m` tune the return
controller; their names are retained only for stored-config compatibility. RETURN uses the same
stateful PI speed governor as F1-F6. `rtm_target_speed_kmh` is its literal 0-50 km/h setpoint
(`0` means zero speed); a non-zero `boogie_vmax_in_followme_kmh` remains an absolute ceiling.

## Follow-Me Mode Override (FM) — Full Guide

> 📖 Rider-facing guide: [FOLLOW_ME_GUIDE.md](docs/FOLLOW_ME_GUIDE.md) · design notes: [DESIGN_FOLLOW_ME.md](DESIGN_FOLLOW_ME.md)

> FM override is fully implemented in V2.5-Evo. It overrides the RX follow-me positioning mode at runtime without a SPIFFS write.

> **⚠️ Follow-Me autonomous control IS implemented in this release (alpha).** The mode override display (F0–F6) is fully functional — you cycle and set the mode on the TX display, and the buggy follows the rider per the selected geometry. F4–F6 are experimental forward-pacer positions. Their activation gate is radial like F1–F3, so the buggy may autonomously travel from behind toward a forward target. **Alpha — bench/wheels-up test the steering direction before any in-water use.**

The override is RAM-only. After a reboot, the TX seeds the next arm from its configured
`followme_mode`; the RX never auto-arms from its stored preference.

### Activation

1. **Combo gesture:** Quick-tap LEFT toggle, then within 3 seconds hold RIGHT toggle for the hold duration (`fm_hold_duration_s`, default 3 s, tunable 3–10 s).
2. TX arms at the configured/last mode and shows `F` + mode number (`F1`–`F6`).
3. To change mode while FM remains armed, release the trigger and let the toggle return to centre briefly.
4. Hold LEFT for the previous mode or RIGHT for the next. The first step occurs after 2 seconds and repeats every 2 seconds while held. Each step is sent immediately to RX.

The armed selector wraps F1↔F6 and deliberately skips F0. Use the existing combo gesture for an
explicit F0/disarm. The radial 2-second separation proof and `FM_ARMED → FM_ACTIVE` lifecycle edge
do not require the trigger to be held. `FM_ACTIVE` can therefore mean ready while the motor and
automatic steering are still off. When the trigger is pulled, RX grants actual automatic authority
through its safe controller reset and engage ramp.

### Modes

| Display | `followme_mode` value | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `F0` | 0 | Disabled — follow-me off |
| `F1` | 1 | Near-Right — RX trails behind-right of the rider |
| `F2` | 2 | Behind (default) — RX trails directly behind the rider |
| `F3` | 3 | Near-Left — RX trails behind-left of the rider |
| `F4` | 4 | Front-Left — forward-left pacer at `near_diag_offset_deg` |
| `F5` | 5 | Front — directly ahead as a forward pacer |
| `F6` | 6 | Front-Right — forward-right pacer at `near_diag_offset_deg` |

For every F1–F6 mode, `fm_engage_dist_m` is a **radial** boundary and must remain exceeded for
2 seconds. That proof continues with the trigger open; the trigger gates motion and automatic
steering, not the proof or `FM_ACTIVE` transition. F4–F6 selected-axis
`zone_angle_enter_deg`/`zone_angle_exit_deg` checks drive only the
periodic warning and never change steering, state or the separation proof. Their signed longitudinal
measurement additionally defines whether uncapped catch-up is safe: an invalid measurement cannot grant
that faster phase. The front modes still have no no-autonomous-overtake guarantee.

While catching up, F1–F6 open speed cap 3 to 255 (maximum rider-requested throttle), independent of
`boogie_vmax_in_followme_kmh`. F1–F3 leave catch-up when they enter the radial
`min_dist_m + followme_smoothing_band_m` zone. F4–F6 do so only while a valid signed front-gap
measurement places the buggy more than one control band behind its selected front station. Their
station radius is `2 × (min_dist_m + followme_smoothing_band_m)` and their steering point adds at
least another two base follow radii of lookahead. Once the corresponding band is reached, F1–F3
return to rider speed +10 km/h and F4–F6 continuously vary from rider speed −10 to +10 km/h. A 2 m
re-entry margin prevents GPS noise from toggling catch-up at the boundary. In-band, a non-zero
`boogie_vmax_in_followme_kmh` remains the absolute PI ceiling; zero removes only that ceiling. For
finite targets, the overspeed backstop removes the cap between target and target +2 km/h.

A compass-vs-GPS-course disagreement no longer blocks F1–F6 by itself. It latches the compass out
of the heading ladder, while a valid live GPS COG or the short held-COG bridge may still engage and
steer Follow-Me. If COG is missing, stale or frozen after that hold, FM still has no valid heading
and remains inactive or ends the active run through its normal heading-fault path.

While FM is following, a deliberate manual steering input temporarily takes steering priority
without cancelling FM; the FM throttle cap and separation proof remain active, and centring the
steering input returns control to FM. Releasing the trigger still stops the motor immediately and
leaves the lifecycle in `FM_ACTIVE`; an ordinary release does not even rewrite the cap because input
throttle is already zero. Geometry/front loss produces one medium vibration immediately and every
3 seconds, including with the trigger released, but has no control effect. If an ACTIVE buggy reaches
`min_dist_m`, cap 0 stops it. Trustworthy distance recovery above that boundary retains the separation
proof and resumes through the normal engage ramp. If the rider instead remains below 2 km/h at/below
`min_dist_m` for 2 seconds, releasing the trigger enters `FM_ARMED`, restores manual cap 255 and clears
both latches; automatic FM then needs another radial `>D_engage` 2-second proof.
Explicit F0/disarm remains the deterministic boundary; genuine sensor/link faults still end the run.

### Throttle-dependent steering (RX)

The RX reduces steering authority progressively at high effective throttle to lower rollover risk.
The curve is applied after manual/automatic steering selection, so it covers normal manual riding,
manual takeover during Follow-Me and automatic Follow-Me identically. It uses `effective_thr` after
the FM safety cap: when motor power is genuinely capped, the matching lower-throttle steering
authority remains available.

| RX parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `steer_reduction_start_pct` | 50% | 30–80% | Full steering at and below this effective throttle; smooth reduction begins above it. |
| `steer_full_throttle_pct` | 35% | 20–100% | Steering authority retained at full throttle; 100% disables the reduction. |

With the defaults, authority is approximately 100% at 50% throttle, 77% at 70%, 58% at 80%,
42% at 90% and 35% at full throttle. This multiplies `steering_influence`: the default 50%
influence therefore becomes 17.5% effective differential influence at full throttle. The limiter
is throttle-based rather than speed-based; bench-test first, then validate at low speed in a clear
area before a full-power run.

### FM Proximity Warning

If TX-to-RX distance drops below `fm_warn_distance_m` (default 150 m), TX fires a 2×Pattern-2 vibration burst warning (2 short × 2, with 300 ms gap).

### FM Engage Distance — measure your rope first (RX)

> **⚠️ Set this before your first Follow-Me session.**

`fm_engage_dist_m` (RX web UI: **Follow-Me → FM Engage Distance**) is how far you have to get from the buggy before Follow-Me may complete its readiness proof. It is the tow-rope interlock: it prevents automatic authority when the trigger is later held while you are still on the rope.

The same effective distance is the one radial activation boundary for every F1–F6 mode. An ordinary
trigger release and a moving min-distance recovery preserve a valid proof. A rider who remains
stationary in `FM_ACTIVE` for 2 seconds always completes through `FM_RETURN`, which clears that
proof; automatic FM must then remain outside this distance for 2 seconds again. With
`fm_engage_dist_m=0`, the automatic value includes the 8 m floor.

**Measure your own tow rope, then set this to at least one metre more than the rope length.** Example: a 20 ft (6.1 m) rope → set **8 m or more**. A longer rope needs a bigger number.

- Valid entries are `0` = auto, or **8–50 m**. The firmware rejects anything between 0 and 8, and clamps an older stored value up to 8 m.
- **8 m is the enforced minimum, not a recommendation** — it is only enough for a rope of about 7 m or shorter.
- Setting it at or below your rope length would let Follow-Me engage while you are still **on** the rope, which is exactly what the interlock prevents.
- `0` = auto: the firmware works it out as 1.5 × (Min Distance + Smoothing Band). Use a measured value if you know your rope.
- You have to stay beyond this distance for 2 seconds before RX enters `FM_ACTIVE`; holding the trigger is not required for that proof.
- Motor and automatic steering still remain off until you hold the trigger, then start through the engage ramp.

### FM Divergence Limit (RX)

`fm_diverge_dist_m` sets the absolute upper distance at which FM_ACTIVE starts checking for
sustained divergence. The firmware raises an explicit value to at least `2 × effective D_engage`
and caps it at 100 m. The default is 100 m. Existing SW35 configurations contain `0` in the reused
reserved slot; that compatibility value reconstructs the previous `6 × D_engage` threshold and
then applies the new 100 m cap.

Crossing the limit alone is not a fault: after the existing engage grace, the buggy must remain
beyond it for 3 seconds without closing by more than 2 m. Example: with `D_engage=11 m`, the minimum
is 22 m. A configured 60 m remains 60 m; a configured 15 m is stored as 22 m. Configure it on the RX
with `?set fm_diverge_dist_m 60`, then `?save`; inspect it with `?get fm_diverge_dist_m`.

### Water Ingress Detection (E71)

When the RX detects moisture inside the buggy housing it sends an **E71** alert to the TX remote.

**What you will see and feel:**
- TX display flashes `E 7` full-screen (250 ms on / 250 ms off)
- TX vibrates with 5 long pulses (500 ms each) — the strongest haptic pattern
- **Motor output is NOT cut** — you can keep riding and drive the buggy back to the beach safely

**How the alert cycle works:**

| Step | What happens | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Confirm | RX requires 2 consecutive wet readings ~20 s apart before alarming. A single splash or brief electrical noise is silently ignored. | — |
| 2 — Alert | `E 7` appears on TX, 5 long buzzes fire. | t = 0 |
| 3 — Auto-clear | Display clears automatically. No power cycle needed. | t ≈ +10 s |
| 4 — Snooze | Sensor stays quiet for ~5 minutes even if still wet — you are not buzzed repeatedly during the ride back. | t ≈ +10 s to +5 min |
| 5 — Repeat | If the buggy is still wet after the snooze the cycle restarts from step 1. | t ≈ +5 min |

To disable wetness detection: set `wet_det_active = 0` in the web configurator.

### GPS Status Dot (C7 R0)

> 📖 Deeper: [GPS configuration](docs/GPS.md) · [wiring the BN-880](docs/GPS_Wiring_BN880_RX.md) · [troubleshooting](docs/hardware/gps-troubleshooting.md)

Visible only when `gps_en = 1`. Located at the top-right corner of the digit area.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Solid | **FM-grade fix** — Follow-Me and FM_RETURN ready |
| Slow blink (1 s) | Acquiring fix — not yet good enough to steer on |
| Fast blink (250 ms) | GPS rejected — spoofing check failed or signal too poor |
| Off | GPS disabled (`gps_en = 0`) |

> **Solid is a quality gate, not a satellite count.** `txGpsGoodFix()` (`Source/V2_Integration_Tx/GPS.ino`)
> requires **all four**: valid position, valid speed, age under `tx_gps_stale_timeout_ms`, and
> **HDOP ≤ `gps_max_hdop`** (default `200` = HDOP 2.0). Tightened 2026-07-20 so the dot matches the
> gate FM actually publishes on — before that it went solid on a fix FM would still refuse.
> Satellite count is deliberately *not* used: a u-blox module has reported 254 km/h and 4800 m as a
> high-confidence fix on **5–7 satellites at HDOP < 3**.

### BT Status Dot (C7 R1)

> 📖 Deeper: [BLE implementation](docs/BLE_Implementation.md) · [phone-app brief](docs/BLE_App_Brief.md)

Located just below the GPS dot. Driven by `bt_dot_state`, controlled by the DRV5032 Hall sensor hold duration on P_MAG (GPIO 9). BREmote already uses Hall-effect sensors for throttle, toggle, and power switch — this adds a fourth on a free GPIO for magnet-based BLE activation. See the [Hall Sensor Expansion guide](docs/Hall_Sensor_Expansion.md) for wiring and firmware details, or the [install tutorial](docs/Hall_Sensor_Install_Tutorial.md) for step-by-step fitting instructions and hardware options (including easier-to-solder alternatives to the SOT-23 package).

| State | `bt_dot_state` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Off | `BT_DOT_OFF` | BLE inactive |
| Slow blink (1 s on/off) | `BT_DOT_SLOW` | BLE ready — toggled by a short Hall sensor hold (400 ms – 4.9 s) |
| Fast blink (250 ms on/off) | `BT_DOT_FAST` | BLE active — triggered by a long hold (5 s+) from slow state |

Releasing the magnet while `BT_DOT_FAST` → returns to `BT_DOT_OFF`. Short hold while `BT_DOT_SLOW` → toggles back to `BT_DOT_OFF`.

> BLE NUS (Nordic UART Service) is in **master** — field-confirmed ✅ (2026-05-16). The stack advertises as `BRemote-TX-XX` (last byte of BT MAC) and serves live VESC telemetry in VESC Tool binary protocol (auto-detected) or CSV push mode for generic NUS apps. Use **VESC Tool** (iOS/Android, free) — scan, connect to `BRemote-TX-XX`, and live gauges appear immediately: FET Temp, Motor Amps, Duty, Voltage, RPM. Enable via the `bt_enabled` SPIFFS field (0=off, 1=Hall/session default, 2=always on) or force for a single session with the `Throttle + LEFT toggle` boot gesture. **Boot on battery** — USB power blocks BLE init.

### How to Enable BLE

Three ways to activate BLE on the TX — choose whichever fits your use:

| Method | How | Persists |
|---|---|---|
| **SPIFFS config** | Set `bt_enabled` via the Web Serial Config Tool or `?set bt_enabled 2` + `?save` over serial. `0`=always off, `1`=Hall/session mode (see below), `2`=always on (BLE starts 5 s after boot every ride). | Across reboots |
| **Boot gesture** | Hold **Throttle + LEFT toggle** while powering on. BLE activates for that session regardless of `bt_enabled`. Display shows `bt`. | Session only |
| **Hall sensor expansion** ([wiring guide](docs/Hall_Sensor_Expansion.md)) | Connect a DRV5032 to GPIO 9 (P_MAG) — BREmote already uses Hall sensors for throttle, toggle, and power switch; this adds a fourth on a free GPIO. With `bt_enabled=1`: short magnet hold (400 ms – 4.9 s) → BT dot slow blink (BLE ready). Long hold (5 s+) from slow state → BT dot fast blink (BLE active). Short hold again → BLE off. | Until magnet gesture or reboot |

> **Always boot on battery.** Plugging in USB during boot triggers the charger detection loop — `initTasks()` never runs and BLE never starts regardless of which method you use.

Once BLE is active, open **VESC Tool** (iOS or Android, free), scan for `BRemote-TX-XX`, connect, and live gauges appear — FET temp, motor amps, duty, voltage, RPM.

### R5 Proximity Bar

Row R5 (just below the digit area, C0–C9) is a Follow-Me proximity indicator. During
FM_RETURN it blinks as a full-width bar; during normal following it shows the distance error.

**FM bar** — expands outward from center sweet spot:

![FM Proximity Bar](docs/fm_bar_animation.gif)

2 pixels at C4–C5 = ideal following distance. Expands symmetrically outward as the buggy lags further behind. 1 pixel = buggy too close.

> See [docs/display-reference.md](docs/display-reference.md) for full implementation details and current FM bar status.

## Alpha Testing Notes

> 📖 Reporting a problem? Use the [Beta testing sheet](docs/Beta_Testing_Sheet.md) so the report is actionable.

BREmote V2.5-Evo is in Alpha. The firmware compiles, has been water tested for control flow and safety gates, and includes anti-spoofing and Follow-Me/FM_RETURN features. Currently running more water tests to graduate to Beta release. If you are an alpha tester building on this fork, the project recommends:

- Test in a controlled environment (shallow water, short range, motors disconnected for first dry run, second run with motors on a leashed test stand) before any open-water use.
- Until the compass EMI behavior on your specific hardware is characterized, treat FM steering as unvalidated. Verify the heading source and steering sign before water tests.
- Manual control must always work even if FM, GPS, or compass fail. Do not rely on autonomous features as the primary safety path.
- Releasing the throttle trigger always stops the motor — this is the failsafe, and it works regardless of what FM or telemetry are doing.

Anyone field-testing this fork should treat each session as data-gathering, not as production use.

### Logging for Tuning

The data logger is the primary tool for validating and tuning the FM/FM_RETURN steering controller during early field sessions. The controller ships with five preset values (Very Soft → Very Sharp) that have been chosen analytically; **empirical validation against your specific hardware and water conditions is required** before trusting any preset on the water. A separate steering-tuning guide and a log-analysis web tool are planned for a later development phase. For now, raw CSV logs viewed in any spreadsheet or plotted with Python / gnuplot will surface the patterns that matter.

**How to record a session (briefly — full details in the Data Logger section above):**

- Power on, wait for GPS lock (entries without fix record zero coordinates).
- Press the AUX button once → green LED flashes 5× → logging starts.
- Run your test (FM_RETURN walk, FM run, manual ride).
- Press AUX again → green LED flashes 2× → logging stops.
- Pull the file via the embedded WebUI Logs panel or via `?download <filename>` over serial.

**Default logging rate:** 3 Hz (333 ms per sample), set in firmware. Override per session with `?lograte <Hz>` over serial — the argument is **Hz, not milliseconds**. Typical values 10 (10 Hz) down to 1 (1 Hz); fractions work, e.g. `?lograte 0.1`. Lower Hz = smaller files = longer sessions; higher Hz = better resolution for tuning fast oscillation.

**Storage note:** if SPIFFS fills too quickly during long sessions, lower the rate with `?lograte`, **don't trim columns** — every diagnostic field is there to make the controller observable when something goes wrong, and the cost of dropping them is much greater than the storage savings.

**Key columns for steering tuning:** level 3 contains 31 columns; current level 4 (`log_level=4`)
contains 82 columns after appending GPS/loop diagnostics plus the FM engage and heading-evidence audits.

> The last five — `remote_error`, `effective_steer`, `tx_distance_m`, `rssi_dbm`, `snr_db` — were added in the 2026-07-19 and 2026-07-24 updates. `rssi_dbm` / `snr_db` are the LoRa link quality measured **at the RX for the packets the TX sent**, i.e. the *command* link, which is the direction that matters for control. `-999` / `-99.0` / `-1.0` are the "no data" sentinels.

For Follow-Me engage diagnosis, select `log_level=4`. The most useful appended columns are
`fm_state`, `fm_block_reason`, `fm_distance_m`, `fm_d_engage_m`, `fm_sep_dwell_ms`,
`fm_sep_latched`, `fm_return_candidate`, `fm_can_be_active`, `fm_front_angle_deg` and
`fm_front_warning`. The remaining named `fm_*_ok` columns expose each individual GPS, heading,
link, trigger and position gate. `fm_block_reason` is already decoded as text such as
`below_d_engage`, `separation_dwell`, `return_candidate`, `no_heading` or `link`; no bit-mask
decoding is required. `fm_can_be_active` means actual automatic-authority eligibility and therefore
still includes the trigger. A trigger-free ready row is `fm_state=ACTIVE`, `fm_sep_latched=1`,
`fm_can_be_active=0`, `fm_block_reason=trigger`. Existing 65-byte Deep log files retain their
original 35-column export.
Existing 83-byte FM-audit files retain their 64-column export. New 96-byte files additionally show
`heading_mode`, `compass_cog_diff_deg`, both disagreement dwell timers, COG/snapshot ages and raw
`cog_*` / `heading_*` validity flags. These columns distinguish a missing, stale, too-slow or frozen
COG from an active COG hold and from a real compass disagreement.

| Column | Meaning | Why it matters for tuning |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp_ms` | Time since boot (ms) | X-axis for any plot |
| `speed_kmh` | RX GPS speed (km/h) | Confirms whether buggy is moving fast enough for GPS COG to be primary heading source |
| `latitude` / `longitude` | RX position | Plot the actual path; visual sanity-check |
| `thr_received` | Final throttle command (0–254) | What the user requested vs what FM allowed |
| `rtm_source` | Heading source picked: 0=none, 1=GPS COG, 2=compass snapshot, 3=live compass | Confirms layered logic chose the right source at each moment |
| `rtm_confidence` | 3=HIGH, 2=MED, 1=LOW, 0=none | Modifier on steering authority |
| `rtm_rx_active` | Retired compatibility column; always 0 | Preserves the historical CSV schema |
| `rtm_steer_override` | Final steering output (127 = straight) | What the buggy was told to do |
| `rtm_heading_chosen_dx10` | Heading used for steering (0.1° units) | What the controller used as "current heading" |
| `gps_course_dx10` | Raw GPS COG (0.1° units) | Independent reference for direction-of-travel |
| `compass_live_dx10` | Live compass (0.1° units) | Independent reference; diverges from GPS COG under motor EMI |
| `cog_age_ms_div10` | GPS COG freshness (10 ms units, ≤150 = fresh) | Confirms COG didn't go stale |
| `fm_state` / `fm_block_reason` | Exact FM lifecycle state and first effective blocker | Explains why an engage did or did not occur without reconstructing short-circuit order |
| `cog_live_valid` / `cog_hold_valid` / `cog_frozen_moving` | GPS heading ladder verdicts | Distinguishes live COG, the dropout bridge and a rejected frozen course |
| `compass_cog_diff_deg` / `heading_compare_possible` / `heading_disagree_now` | Signed source difference and whether it was measurable/failing now | Shows whether a large raw difference was actually eligible evidence |
| `heading_disagree_dwell_ms` / `heading_agree_dwell_ms` / `heading_disagree_latched` | Set/clear proof progress and persisted verdict | Shows exactly when the compass withdrawal was building, standing or clearing |
| **`heading_error_dx10`** | Bearing-to-target − current-heading (0.1° units; 32767 = no data) | **Primary tuning signal — magnitude and oscillation visible here** |
| **`d_error_dx10`** | Rate-of-change of heading error (0.1°/sec) | **Kd tuning signal — high during settling = need more damping** |
| `motor_current_A`, `voltage_V`, `ERPM` | VESC telemetry | Power/load context; correlates compass EMI with current draw |

The two **bold** columns (`heading_error_dx10`, `d_error_dx10`) were added specifically to make steering tuning data-driven. Plot them over time during an FM/FM_RETURN run: sustained ±20–50° wobble at 1–3 Hz means the buggy is snaking and the active preset has too little damping; smooth curves trending to zero mean the controller is working.

### Bugs Found and Fixed Between Upstream and V2.5-Evo

> BREmote V2.5-Evo is a fork of Jan's BREmote V2 codebase, which itself extends Ludwig's original BREmote. The architecture decisions (3-byte addressing, CRC8 pairing, semaphore-driven LoRa ISR, the Common engine pattern) are from upstream and are sound. The issues below were uncovered during the V2.5-Evo audit. Some are defects that existed in the upstream regardless of feature set; others only became safety-relevant when V2.5-Evo added concurrent GPS polling, Phase A anti-spoofing, RTM, and FM, which significantly increased the loop-task workload.

| # | Issue | V2.5-Evo file:line | Note | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Watchdog 1000ms timeout | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/Init.ino:52-58` | Adequate for upstream feature set; insufficient under V2.5-Evo combined GPS (~300ms) + wetness (~300ms) + VESC (~210ms) load (~810ms peak, ~190ms margin). | Raised to 3000ms with full load math in source comment. |
| 2 | `vesc_struct` cross-core race | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/VESC.ino`, `Logger.ino` | `vesc` written on core 1, read on core 0; no synchronization. Defect existed upstream; harder to hit there because Logger ran less aggressively. | Added `vescMutex` semaphore, 50ms take timeout on both readers and writer. |
| 3 | `logging_active` non-volatile flag | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/Logger.ino` | Compiler-cached value across cores; flag toggle from one core not always seen by the other. | Declared `volatile`. |
| 4 | `ensureFreeSpace()` could delete the active log file | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/Logger.ino` | Free-space loop iterated all `.log` files including the one currently being written. | Active log file path now excluded from deletion candidates. |
| 5 | `readBCFromSPIFFS()` heap out-of-bounds | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/SPIFFS.ino` | Decoded payload < 102 bytes overran a fixed-size struct copy. | Length check added: `decodedLen < 102` rejects short files. |
| 6 | `triggeredReceive` and `generatePWM` 2048-byte stacks | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/Init.ino:41-43` | Stack size adequate for upstream; tight under V2.5-Evo with RadioLib SX1262 path + RMT driver + Phase A + meta-packet decoding. | Raised to 4096 / 4096 / 3072. Use `?printtasks` to monitor high-water marks. |
| 7 | `scanI2C()` re-initialized Wire mid-runtime | `Source/V2_Integration_Rx/System.ino:157-196` | Function inherited from upstream; `Wire.begin()` inside the scan reset I2C and could glitch in-progress AW9523 traffic. | Removed redundant `Wire.begin()`; Wire is now only initialized once in `initHardware()`. |

### Compass EMI Load Test — `?magtest`

**This is a BUCKET / DOCK TEST. The motor must be under real load. Do not run it free-spinning.**

`?magtest` measures how much motor current pulls your magnetometer off true. It streams CSV at
10 Hz (millis, mag X/Y/Z, magnitude, heading, VESC ERPM, motor current, throttle) for up to 120 s
and then **prints a verdict** — it no longer leaves you to interpret 1200 rows yourself.

#### Why the load matters more than anything else here

The same buggy was measured twice:

| How it was run | Reported error |
|---|---|
| Bench, prop **free-spinning** | +3 to +5° steady |
| Bucket, prop **under real load** | **87–101°** |

**Seven times worse under load.** A free-spinning prop draws almost no current, so it reads clean
on a compass that is 100° out in the water. The free-spinning result is what originally supported
"relocation is not urgent" — it was wrong, and the conclusion stood for weeks.

`?magtest` now **refuses to grade a run whose peak current stayed under 5 A** rather than
reporting a meaningless number.

#### How to run it

1. Prop in a **bucket of water**, or held against the dock/ground — something that makes it pull
   real current.
2. Leave the throttle at **zero for ~5 seconds**. This sets the motor-off baseline.
3. Bring the throttle **up slowly**, holding at several levels so each current band gets samples.
4. Read the verdict at the end.

#### Reading the verdict

| Worst error under load | Verdict | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **< 10°** | GOOD | Usable as a live heading, not just the motor-off snapshot. |
| **10–30°** | DEGRADED | Steering is unaffected — the firmware only reads the compass with the motor off — but the compass-vs-GPS cross-check still cannot run during a ride. |
| **> 30°** | USELESS UNDER POWER | Trustworthy only at zero throttle. Move the module. |

One measured detail worth knowing: in that 87–101° dataset the error **did not scale with
current.** It was already 87° at 5–15 A — ordinary cruise — and only reached 101° at 40 A. It
**saturates**, because the interference is already far stronger than the earth's field at the
first few amps, so the needle stops measuring the earth and starts pointing at the motor.

**That makes this a geometry problem, not a current problem.** It cannot be fixed by riding
gently, and it cannot be fixed by calibration — calibration removes *fixed* errors, and this one
changes with throttle, so there is nothing steady to cancel out. **Distance and wire routing are
the only levers.**

#### Where to mount the module

- **As far from the phase wires and battery cables as you can get it.** Two inches makes a huge
  difference at close range.
- **Never over a loop or U-turn in the phase wires.** This is the single worst position and it is
  easy to create by accident. Out-and-back wires cancel each other's field *at a distance*, but at
  the centre of the loop they **add**, and a current loop behaves like a magnet whose field there
  is far stronger than a straight wire at the same spacing. If the module sits above where the
  phase wires turn back on themselves, move it before you change anything else.
- **Twist the phase wires into a tight bundle.** Paired conductors cancel, and the leftover field
  then falls away much faster with distance than a single wire's does. This can buy more than the
  relocation itself.
- **Mount it square to the nose** — see the compass mounting section. Squareness and EMI are
  separate problems with separate fixes; you generally want both.
- After moving it, **re-run `?compasscal`**, then re-run this test to confirm the improvement.

## RX Serial Diagnostic Commands

Connect to the RX at 115200 baud. All commands are prefixed with `?`.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `?conf` | Print current RX config (all SPIFFS fields and their live values) |
| `?vescping` | Send a single VESC status request and print the parsed response — confirms the UART link is alive |
| `?vescraw` | Send a correctly-framed `COMM_GET_VALUES` probe (`02 01 04 40 84 03`) and dump the raw reply bytes — use when `?vescping` returns no data to diagnose framing issues. *(The probe CRC was fixed in V2.5.12; before that this command hardcoded a bad CRC and always printed "NO BYTES" even against a healthy VESC.)* |
| `?logstat` | Print SPIFFS log storage statistics — file count, total bytes used, bytes free |
| `?lograte <Hz>` | Override logging rate per session. **Argument is Hz.** Example: `?lograte 10` = 10 Hz, `?lograte 0.1` = one sample per 10 s. Change is RAM-only; resets on reboot. |
| `?deletelog <filename>` | Delete a specific log file from SPIFFS. Use `?list` to see filenames first. |
| `?deleteallogs` | Delete all log files from SPIFFS (skips the currently active log if logging is running) |
| `?list` | List all log files on SPIFFS with sizes |
| `?download <filename>` | Stream a log file as raw CSV over serial |
| `?start` / `?stop` | Start or stop the data logger (same as AUX button) |
| `?compassheading` | Stream live compass heading (degrees) at 10 Hz — useful for verifying QMC5883L orientation and EMI influence |
| `?printcompass` | Print a single raw compass reading (X/Y/Z counts) — quick sanity check without streaming |
| `?magtest` | **Bucket/dock EMI test + verdict.** Streams CSV (mag X/Y/Z, heading, VESC ERPM, motor current, throttle) at 10 Hz for up to 120 s, then grades the result. ⚠️ **The motor MUST be under load** — a free-spinning run reads clean on a compass that is 100° out. Refuses to grade below 5 A peak. See the Compass EMI Load Test section above |
| `?compasscal` | Run the 45 s compass calibration. **Nose on NORTH → two full CLOCKWISE circles → finish on north.** Sets the iron calibration, the mounting handedness and the mounting orientation in one run. BIND LED: 2 = full success, 3 = PARTIAL (orientation not updated — walk it again), 10 = nothing saved |
| `?magalign` | Re-derive the compass **mounting orientation only** — point the nose at north, hold steady, 5 s average. Needs an existing iron calibration; cannot detect a mirrored module |
| `?printrssi` | Print current LoRa RSSI and SNR |
| `?printtasks` | Print FreeRTOS task stack high-water marks — use to verify stack headroom after tuning |
| `?printgps` | Print current RX GPS fix (lat, lon, speed, fix type) |
| `?printbat` | Print RX battery voltage reading |

## TX Serial Diagnostic Commands

Connect to the TX at 115200 baud. All commands are prefixed with `?`.

| `?printtasks` | `[json]` | FreeRTOS task stack high-water marks |
| `?printpackets` | | TX/RX packet counts |
| `?printgps` | | TX GPS state and current fix status |
| `?gpsraw` | `[sec]` | Dump raw NMEA output from GPS module (default 5 s, type `quit` to abort) |
| `?gpsreinit` | | Re-run `initTxGPS()` without rebooting — useful after cable swap |
| `?gpscoldreset` | | Send UBX-CFG-RST cold-restart to GPS module (clears all cached satellite data) |

## Changelog

### V2.5.12 — July 2026 *(monterman)* — VESC Telemetry Restored, FM Mode Mapping Canonicalized, Tunable Arm-Hold

- **VESC telemetry restored — the long-standing "no telemetry" issue was a wrong CRC in the `?vescraw` diagnostic; the actual telemetry path was always correct.** The `?vescraw` command hardcoded the wrong CRC16 (`0x4007`) on its `COMM_GET_VALUES` probe. The correct value is `0x4084` — CRC16-CCITT/XMODEM (poly `0x1021`, init 0) over payload `{0x04}`. A VESC silently discards any bad-CRC packet and never replies at any baud, so `?vescraw` always printed "NO BYTES" even against a perfectly healthy VESC — a false negative that masked good hardware and sent the diagnosis chasing the VESC, RX, AW9523 MUX, cables, and firmware when none of them were at fault. Bench-proven over an FTDI on **both VESC FW 6.05 and 6.06**: the correct frame `02 01 04 40 84 03` returns a full GET_VALUES reply (live 39.5 V / 26.7 °C). The real telemetry path (`getValuesSelective` → `sendToVESC` → `vesc_crc16`) was always correct — only the `?vescraw` diagnostic frame was wrong.
- **In-ride telemetry unfroze (RX):** removed a throttle-skip gate that skipped the VESC poll while throttle ≥ 25. On a continuous-throttle vehicle (tow buggy) that meant `getVescLoop()` never ran once you were on the trigger, freezing telemetry to dashes for the whole ride. Reverted to the SW55 unconditional 2 Hz poll; the MUX-EMI concern the gate targeted is already covered by the read-back-verify in `setUartMux()`.
- **FM mode mapping canonicalized to `1 = Near-Right, 2 = Behind, 3 = Near-Left` (RX):** RX comments and web-UI labels were relabeled to match the TX convention already used on the display, in the TX web UI, and in this README. Both boards ship `defaultConf.followme_mode = 2` (Behind — the defensive FM geometry); every surface (web UI `def:`, HTML tool, README, guide) now states the default as **2 (Behind)**. The `foiler_low_speed` default text was corrected `5 → 8` km/h to match `defaultConf`. Labels and defaults only — no control-logic change, no confStruct / SW_VERSION change.
- **TX arm-hold now tunable:** `rtm_hold_duration_s` (RTM LEFT-hold) and `fm_hold_duration_s` (FM RIGHT-hold) are now live SPIFFS fields, configurable 4–10 s. Both were previously hardcoded to 5 s and labeled "reserved" in the web UI. Default stays 5 s. No confStruct / SW_VERSION change.
- **`DESIGN_FOLLOW_ME.md` added:** the design spec for FM autonomous following (state machine, activation gates, target-point math, throttle cap chain). **FM autonomous following is implemented in this release.** Selecting an FM mode (F0–F3) cycles and stores the mode and makes the buggy follow the rider.
- **No confStruct changes; SW_VERSION unchanged (TX/RX).**

---

### V2.5.11 — July 2026 *(monterman)* — Collision Backoff, RX Radio Self-Heal, No-OTA Partition & 3 Hz Logger

- **Feature A — adaptive RF collision backoff (TX `sendData()`):** two remotes sharing the same RF preset no longer stay locked in a colliding timeslot. On a missed telemetry reply the TX adds slot-jitter that permanently phase-shifts it into a different slot, and after 3 consecutive misses the base cadence drops 100 ms → 200 ms, recovering to 100 ms after ~50 s of clean replies. *Upstream collision-detection mechanism by LudwigBre (2.2.7)* — adapted for this fork: variable send cadence, the GPS meta-packet ≥2 Hz floor is preserved by gating the backoff off while Follow-Me/RTM is active, and the jitter PRNG is seeded per-unit from `own_address` so identical units actually de-correlate.
- **Feature C — RX SX1262 self-heal:** the RX `triggeredReceive()` semaphore-timeout branch now re-arms the radio (`implicitHeader(6)` + `startReceive()`). Previously a wedged SX1262 or a dropped DIO interrupt left the link dead until a power-cycle; now it recovers on its own after 2 s of silence. Motor-safe — runs only when the link is already down and the failsafe has zeroed throttle.
- **Logger default 5 Hz → 3 Hz:** better suited to propeller / max-speed testing and stretches on-board session capacity. Raise to 5 Hz at runtime for RTM/steering analysis with `?lograte 5` over serial (resets to the 3 Hz default on reboot; the rate is not persisted). Record size, rate→duration table, and capacity guidance: see `docs/LOGGER_NOTES.md`.
- **Custom no-OTA partition (RX):** OTA is intentionally dropped (RX is flashed over USB), reclaiming the second app slot for a single 2.0 MB app + 1.875 MB SPIFFS layout (`Source/V2_Integration_Rx/partitions.csv`). Gives ~809 KB of app headroom for Follow-Me work and a larger SPIFFS than before for longer logging. First flash after the partition change reformats SPIFFS → RX settings reset and compass re-cal required (binding survives).
- **No confStruct changes; SW_VERSION unchanged (TX/RX).** TX compiles at 39% of the huge_app slot; RX at 60% of the new 2.0 MB app slot.

### SW56–SW58 — May 2026 *(monterman)* — BLE Live Telemetry Released to Master

**BLE feature merged from `feature/bluetooth` → `master` — field-confirmed ✅ (2026-05-16):**

- **NUS + VESC binary protocol:** TX advertises `BRemote-TX-XX` (last byte of BT MAC). Connect with VESC Tool (iOS/Android, free) and get live gauges — FET temp, motor amps, duty cycle, battery voltage, RPM — sourced from whatever the LoRa link is carrying from the foil.
- **Auto-detect mode:** First `COMM_GET_VALUES` request → VESC protocol mode (app-driven). No request within 500 ms → CSV push mode (generic NUS serial apps).
- **`bt_enabled` SPIFFS config:** 0=always off, 1=Hall-sensor/session mode, 2=always on after 5s boot. Boot gesture: `Throttle + LEFT toggle` forces BLE for the session.
- **BT dot display (C7 R1):** Slow blink = BLE ready, Fast blink = BLE active.
- **Advertisement fix:** NUS UUID in main advert (21 B, fits BLE 31-byte limit); device name in scan response — UUID scan filters work correctly in VESC Tool and Floaty.
- **Expanded LoRa packet 8→19 bytes:** `foil_voltage`, `foil_duty`, `foil_erpm_hi/lo` now carried over LoRa from RX, decoded by TX and served via BLE.
- **Dependency:** NimBLE-Arduino 2.x (install via Arduino Library Manager).
- **Boot note:** Always boot on battery for BLE — USB-C power triggers `checkCharger()` and blocks `initTasks()`.

---

### SW51–SW55 — May 2026 *(monterman)* — VESC Telemetry Fix, Display Polish, RTM Bench-Complete

**VESC telemetry — root cause confirmed and fixed:**
- **Primary root cause:** USB-C serial cable on GPIO 18/19 silences VESC UART during field use — ESP32-C3 native USB D−/D+ shares these pins with Serial1. Operational fix: unplug USB-C during field use.
- **SW55:** GPS MUX not yielding — `getGPSLoop()` and `configureGPS()` now call `setUartMux(0)` on return. GPS always has priority on the UART MUX; always yields the bus back to VESC when done.
- **SW55:** `rcv_err` flag persistence bug removed — one stray byte poisoned the full 200 ms receive window. CRC handles frame validation; the flag was redundant and harmful.
- **SW55:** Boot MUX state — `configureGPS()` now ends with `setUartMux(0)` so boot starts with the MUX on the VESC channel.
- **SW54:** MUX retry loops reverted — rapid I2C writes to AW9523 caused bus corruption (GPS chars=0, VESC zero packets).

**Display improvements:**
- **SW53:** `unlockAnimation()` rewritten — 3-frame paintbrush sweep R0→R6; each row stays lit as the arrow descends (`|=` without inter-frame clear); R4–R6 outer columns fully painted; boot delay 3 s → 500 ms.
- **SW55:** Boot timing refined — VI display 250 ms, voltage display 1450 ms; padlock appears at ~4.5 s total boot.

**New features:**
- **DISPLAY_MODE_INTBAT:** 7th TX display mode — shows TX internal LiPo voltage (UB label, C7 R1 BT dot co-located). Cycle: TEMP → THR → SPEED → POWER → AMP → UBat → BAT.
- **LATEST header convention:** Single `// *** LATEST: ... ***` line at top of both integration `.ino` files shows current SW version at a glance.

Compiled clean: TX 39% / RX 40% flash (huge_app). SW_VERSION unchanged: TX=26, RX=31 (no confStruct changes).

### V2.5.08 — April 2026 *(monterman)* — Display, Gesture & UX Overhaul

- **Gesture redesign (breaking):** LEFT hold 2s = lock/unlock the remote; RIGHT hold 2s = cycle display; RIGHT tap→LEFT hold 5s = RTM arm; LEFT tap→RIGHT hold 5s = FM cycle. The remote boots **locked** by default (SPIFFS); LEFT-hold 2s locks/unlocks — kept for safety.
- **RTM arm/disarm display:** static `rn` ×2 (3s total), replaces scrolling `rtn`
- **FM mode display:** `F0`/`F1`/`F2`/`F3` instead of named abbreviations
- **RTM/FM active info display:** TX shows distance-to-TX or speed on dot matrix while RTM/FM active; `rtm_display_mode` configures mode (0=distance, 1=speed, 2=alternating 2.5s); distance shown as `X.X` m below 10m with C3 decimal dot, `XX` m above
- **RX→TX distance telemetry:** RX computes and encodes distance into `telemetry.rtm_distance` (TelemetryPacket index 5); TX decodes for display
- **Vibration Pattern 4:** 2×80ms fast short pulses for RTM arm/disarm confirmation
- **RTM steer exit gate:** steering input exits RTM when `rtm_steer_exit_on_input=1` (default)
- **`rtm_max_runtime_s` default 120→0** (0=disabled; safety gates handle all real scenarios)
- **`displayDigits()` clamp bug fixed:** clamp raised 29→33; LET_R/LET_N/LET_S/LET_M now display correctly (was silently rendering as blank)
- **Unlock animation 2× faster:** ANIMATION_DELAY 80ms→40ms
- **ET error handler:** remote_error=20 (LET_T) shows `--` and auto-clears after 3s; no vibration
- **3 new TX SPIFFS fields:** `rtm_display_mode`, `fm_warn_distance_m`, `rtm_steer_exit_on_input`
- **TelemetryPacket grows:** `rtm_distance` added at index 5; `link_quality` moved to index 6 (sizeof 6→7); TX+RX bounds-check auto-adapts
- **confStruct sizeof:** TX 120→126, RX unchanged. First P8 flash resets TX settings to defaults.

### V2.5.10 — April 2026 *(monterman)* — R5 Proximity Bar, Distance Units, Full-Screen Messages

- **R5 proximity bar:** Row R5 (C0–C9) lights as proximity indicator during RTM and FM. Blinks 1 s on / 500 ms off.
  - RTM bar: square-root shrink curve, full at arm distance, gone at hard stop (C0→C9 left-fill, shrinks from right)
  - FM bar: linear fill (placeholder — center-expanding from C4–C5 intended; separate future change)
- **Distance unit display:** `dist_unit` SPIFFS param — 0=metres/km, 1=feet/miles. All distance math stays in metres; conversion is display-layer only. No sizeof change (fills tail padding).
- **Stop display:** RTM exit now shows `St` in large-font (`displayDigits(LET_S, LET_T)`) for 2 s. Arm confirm is unlock animation + `rn` blink. Compact-font full-screen messages for stop and arm were introduced then replaced by large-font `St` in the same P9 cycle (Bug4/Chg5 in RTMState.ino).
- **`FM 0`–`FM 3` and `E 7`** still use compact 3×7 full-screen font. (Error code E71 — display renders as `E 7` due to screen width.)
- **Old scrolling `Stp`** (scroll3Digits LET_S LET_T LET_P) removed.
- **FM proximity warning vibration:** TX fires 2×Pattern-2 burst when TX-RX distance drops below `fm_warn_distance_m` (default 150 m).
- **`dist_unit` new TX SPIFFS field.** No sizeof change.

### V2.5.09 — April 2026 *(monterman)* — Stability, GPS Hz, Approach Zone

- **Gate 9 clean disengagement:** RTM hard stop is now a clean handoff to manual — no emergency stop, no display glitch. Throttle ramps to 0 in approach zone then disengages seamlessly.
- **RTM re-arm fix:** Non-zero sentinel (0xFF) used when RTM inactive — zero-init throttle no longer falsely passes arm guard.
- **Approach decel zone:** `rtm_approach_zone_m` (default 15 m) — linear throttle ramp to 0 begins this many metres before the hard stop distance.
- **GPS non-blocking:** GPS polling restructured to avoid stalling the 10 Hz LoRa cycle. `gps_update_hz` SPIFFS param controls update rate (default 2 Hz; 5 Hz recommended for RTM direction tuning, but uses more bandwidth).
- **`vesc_timeout_s` SPIFFS param:** VESC "not available" timeout configurable (was hardcoded 20 s).
- **`radio_preset` capped at 2:** Value 3 caused `radioErrorHalt` on boot; max now enforced in ConfigService.
- **startTransmit() errors now logged:** Return value was silently discarded; now printed to serial on failure.
- **`gps_max_teleport_kmh` default 200→80:** 80 km/h = 2× craft max speed (was unrealistically permissive).
- **3 new TX SPIFFS fields:** `rtm_approach_zone_m`, `gps_update_hz`, `vesc_timeout_s`.
- **RX confStruct sizeof:** 156→160 (approach zone field + alignment pad). First P8.4 flash resets all RX settings to defaults — re-pair, re-configure, re-run `?compasscal`.

### V2.5.01 — April 2026 *(monterman)*

- Fork established as BREmote V2.5-Evo
- Full codebase audit completed — 7 critical bugs and 10 important issues documented
- TX GPS reading implemented: Beitian BN-220 on Serial1 GPIO 18/19, UBX binary init (115200 baud, 5 Hz), non-blocking polling — does not stall the 10 Hz LoRa cycle
- GPS speed display in km/h, knots, and mph via `speed_src` SPIFFS parameter (values 2, 3, 5)
- All user parameters SPIFFS-configurable via the Web Serial Config Tool — nothing hardcoded
- Web Serial Config Tool created (offline HTML, no install required)
- `DESIGN_RETURN_TO_ME.md` added — RTM mode fully designed with state machines, safety gates, and SPIFFS parameter table
- LoRa meta-packet protocol designed: opcodes 0xF1–0xFE reserved for V2.5-Evo autonomous assist features
- SW_VERSION bumped to 3
- `project notes` added for development conventions and standing safety rules
