# BREmote V2.5-Evo — Dot Display Reference

## Hardware
Two 5×7 LED matrices side by side = 10 columns × 7 rows = 70 red LEDs
Driver: HT16K33 at I2C address 0x70

## Zone Map
| Zone | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Digits | C0-C2 (left) + C4-C6 (right), R0-R4 | Two character display |
| Gap | C3, R0-R4 | Normally dark — separates digits; **R3** used as decimal dot during RTM/FM distance display (raised from R4 2026-07-25 for legibility) |
| GPS status | C7 R0 only | V2.5-Evo — see below |
| BLE status | C7 R1 only | V2.5-Evo SW55 — see below |
| Temperature | C8, R0-R4 | VESC temp, fills bottom→top |
| Signal | C9, R0-R4 | LoRa signal, fills bottom→top |
| R5 proximity bar | R5, C0-C9 | RTM/FM proximity indicator — NEW in P9 (see below) |
| Battery | R6, all cols | VESC battery, fills left→right |

## GPS Status Dot (C7 R0) — V2.5-Evo
Only visible when `gps_en = 1` in SPIFFS config.

| State | Display | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Solid green | ● | Valid GPS fix — ready for RTM/Follow-Me |
| Slow blink 1s | ○ ● ○ ● | Acquiring fix — waiting for satellites |
| Fast blink 250ms | ●●●● | GPS rejected — spoofing or bad signal alert |
| Off | (dark) | GPS disabled (`gps_en = 0`) |

## BLE Status Dot (C7 R1) — V2.5-Evo SW55
Controlled by `bt_dot_state`, driven by the DRV5032 Hall sensor on P_MAG (GPIO 9). Never solid — always blinking or off. Only visible when BLE is active.

| State | `bt_dot_state` | Display | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Off | `BT_DOT_OFF` | (dark) | BLE inactive — default on boot |
| Slow blink 1s | `BT_DOT_SLOW` | ○ ● ○ ● | BLE ready — toggled by short Hall hold (400 ms – 4.9 s) |
| Fast blink 250ms | `BT_DOT_FAST` | ●○●○ | BLE active — long Hall hold 5 s+ from slow state |

Releasing the magnet while `BT_DOT_FAST` → returns to `BT_DOT_OFF`. Short hold while `BT_DOT_SLOW` → toggles back to `BT_DOT_OFF`. BLE NUS + VESC Tool binary protocol released in master — field-confirmed 2026-05-16. Connect with VESC Tool (iOS/Android, free): scan for `BRemote-TX-XX`, connect, live gauges appear immediately.

## Decimal Dot (C3 R3) — Distance Display

**Changed 2026-07-25.** The dot is now a **true decimal point, always** — it no longer means "×100". Distance is shown in **metres only** this version (`dist_unit` is retained in SPIFFS; feet is parked and not rendered).

| Distance | Shows | Dot |
|---|---|---|
| < 1 m | `00` | no |
| 0–9.9 m | `X.X` — e.g. `1.7` = **1.7 m** | **yes**, C3 R3 |
| 10–99 m | `XX` whole metres — e.g. `17` = 17 m | no |
| ≥ 100 m | scrolling **`FAR`** | no |

- **Why it changed:** the dot previously meant ×100 above 100 m, so 170 m rendered as `1.7` and read as 1.7 m. That misread cost a rider control authority in the field. One meaning now: a dot is a decimal point.
- **Why `FAR` instead of a number:** the digit zone is two characters, so 100 m+ cannot render literally. A scrolling word is unmistakable against every static state (`L#`, `E#`, `F1/2/3/4`, `99`, `XX`, `--`). It scrolls in the digit zone only — the R5 proximity bar, C7 status dots and C8/C9 bars are untouched, and it does not flash.
- **Row position:** the dot sits at **R3** (raised one row from R4 on 2026-07-25 — on the bottom row it was hard to read). C3 is never written by `displayDigits()`, so the dot cannot collide with a digit at any row.
- Set via `displayBuffer[4] |= (1u << 3)` **after** calling `displayDigits()` (which clears R0–R5, R3 included). The kW readout uses the same row so the decimal point is at a consistent height everywhere.

## Vibration Feedback Patterns — V2.5-Evo P8
| Pattern | Feel | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 2 short (150ms) | Gentle | Low VESC battery warning (Pattern 1) |
| 5 short (150ms) | Urgent | LoRa connection lost OR GPS rejected (Pattern 2) |
| 5 long (500ms) | Emergency | Water detected inside buggy — E71 (Pattern 3) |
| 2 fast short (80ms) | Quick confirm | RTM arm / RTM disarm confirmed (Pattern 4) — NEW in P8 |

## Gesture Map — V2.5-Evo P8 (Breaking Change from P7)
| Gesture | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LEFT tap | Record tap (starts 3s combo window) | Sets up combo |
| RIGHT tap | Record tap (starts 3s combo window) | Sets up combo |
| LEFT hold 2s | Lock remote; if FM armed + trigger released: previous F1–F6 mode every 2s | Armed selector skips F0 |
| RIGHT hold 2s | Cycle telemetry display; if FM armed + trigger released: next F1–F6 mode every 2s | Armed selector skips F0 |
| RIGHT tap → LEFT hold | No autonomous action | Standalone RTM gesture retired |
| LEFT tap → RIGHT hold (`fm_hold_duration_s`) | Cycle FM mode (F0→F1→F2→F3→F4→F5→F6) | Requires gps_en=1 and fm_override_enabled=1 |
| Boot: hold RIGHT | Pairing mode | RIGHT toggle held at boot (no throttle) enters pairing; RIGHT + throttle = wipe SPIFFS |
| Boot: hold LEFT | Calibration mode | LEFT toggle held at boot (no throttle) starts calibration; LEFT + throttle = force BLE session |

**Notes:**
- Lock is available when `no_lock=0`; the armed FM LEFT hold takes precedence while FM is armed.
- Throttle must be at 0 for long-press actions to fire. Return the toggle to centre briefly after releasing it so the steering block can clear.
- Armed LEFT/RIGHT selection sends every step immediately and wraps only through F1–F6. F0 remains an explicit combo-disarm action.
- Tap window: 3s (`COMBO_WINDOW_MS`). Tap must occur before the hold begins.

## Display Modes (RIGHT toggle hold 2s cycles through while FM is disarmed)

Cycle is `DISPLAY_MODE_COUNT = 7`. Modes with unavailable data (sentinel `0xFF`) are skipped automatically — `cycleDisplayMode()` loops until it finds an available mode.

| # | Code | Full name | Shows | Available when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | tP | Temperature | VESC FET temp °C | VESC connected (`foil_temp != 0xFF`) |
| 1 | tH | Throttle | 0–99% trigger pull | Always |
| 2 | 5P | Speed | km/h, knots or mph per `speed_src` | TX GPS: always (`--` when no fix); RX GPS: fix required |
| 3 | PV | VESC Power | Battery-side power in kW, 1 decimal (e.g. `4.4` = 4400 W, capped 9.9 kW) | VESC connected (`foil_power != 0xFF`) |
| 4 | MA | Motor Amps | Motor current in whole amps (0–250 A) | VESC connected (`foil_motor_amps != 0xFF`) |
| 5 | Ub | Internal battery | TX LiPo voltage ×10 (e.g. `42` = 4.2 V) | Always |
| 6 | bA | VESC battery | Remaining % (0–100) | VESC connected (`foil_bat != 0xFF`) |

Default boot mode: `DISPLAY_MODE_THR` (mode 1). VESC timeout resets `foil_bat`, `foil_temp`, `foil_power`, `foil_motor_amps` to `0xFF`, hiding VESC-dependent modes automatically when the ESC is offline.

## Boot Sequence Timing — SW55

Total boot-to-padlock: ~4.5 seconds.

| Phase | Duration | Display |
|---|---|---|
| Firmware init | ~100 ms | Dark |
| VI splash | 250 ms | `VI` (version info) |
| Battery voltage | 1450 ms | Voltage reading (e.g. `42` = 4.2 V) — user reads battery before padlock |
| Unlock animation | ~700 ms | Paintbrush sweep R0→R6 (see below) |
| Operational | — | Default mode: `tH` (throttle %) |

## Unlock Animation — SW53 Paintbrush Sweep

`unlockAnimation()` runs at the end of boot. 3 frames, each ~230 ms.

**Frame sequence** — arrow descends row by row, each row stays lit (no inter-frame clear):

| Frame | Rows lit |
|---|---|
| 1 | R0 lit — top bar only |
| 2 | R0 + R1 + R2 lit — arrow growing downward |
| 3 | R0 → R6 fully lit — all rows painted |

Column rule: R0–R3 light C1–C8 (inner columns). R4–R6 also paint C0 and C9 (outer columns fully). Uses `|=` to accumulate pixels across frames — no `clear()` between frames, so each row stays lit as the arrow descends. Boot delay was 3 s before SW53; reduced to 500 ms.

## RTM / FM Active Display — V2.5-Evo P8 + P9
When `rtm_tx_active == true`, normal display is replaced by RTM info display.
Controlled by `rtm_display_mode` SPIFFS field:

| Mode | Shows | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (default) | Distance to TX | Unit-aware via `dist_unit` (see Distance Unit section below) |
| 1 | Speed | Same source as normal speed display (speed_src) |
| 2 | Alternating | Switches between distance and speed every 2.5s |

Distance is computed on RX side and sent via `telemetry.rtm_distance` (index 5).
Encoding: 0-99 = tenths of meter (0.0–9.9m); 100-254 = value-90 meters (100=10m, 199=109m).
TX decodes this value then routes it through `displayDistanceInUnits()` for unit conversion.

## Distance Unit Display (`dist_unit` SPIFFS field) — **superseded 2026-07-25**

> ⚠️ **The table below describes the OLD behaviour and no longer matches the firmware.** The ×100 dot was removed — see [Decimal Dot (C3 R3)](#decimal-dot-c3-r3--distance-display) above for what the display actually does now. Kept for historical reference only.
>
> **Current behaviour:** metres only for both `dist_unit` values (feet is parked, the field is retained in SPIFFS so a future version can implement it). `<1 m` → `00` · `0–9.9 m` → `X.X` with a **true decimal** dot at C3 R3 · `10–99 m` → whole metres · `≥100 m` → scrolling `FAR`.

<details><summary>Historical: the original P9 dist_unit ranges (removed)</summary>

| dist_unit | Unit | Range A | Range B (decimal dot active) | Minimum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (default) | Metres / km | 1–99 m → whole metres ("01"–"99") | 100+ m → X.X km ("1.0"–"9.9") | <1 m → "00" |
| 1 | Feet / miles | 4–99 ft → whole feet ("04"–"99") | 100+ ft → X.X mi ("0.1"–"9.9") | <4 ft → "00" |

The dot lit only in Range B and meant ×100 — that is the ambiguity that was removed.
</details>

- Internal math is always metres. Unit conversion is display-layer only.
- `displayDistanceInUnits(float dist_m)` in Display.ino handles all cases.

## Full-Screen Confirmation Messages (P9 New — fontCompact3x7)
One-time blocking flashes rendered using the compact 3×7 font (all 10 columns × all 7 rows).
Source font: `docs/Dot_Matrix_Display_10x7_Render.html` — canonical pixel layout reference.

| Message | Columns | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| *(removed)* `A rM` | — | Arm confirm replaced by unlock animation + `rn` 2s blink (removed in P9 Bug4) |
| `St` | large-font `displayDigits(LET_S, LET_T)` — not compact font | RTM disengages (any exit path) or pre-arm rejected |
| `F0` – `F6` | large `LET_F` + mode digit | FM arm/combo confirmation or armed LEFT/RIGHT mode selection |
| `E 7` | E(3) + space(1) + 7(3) = 7 columns | Water ingress error code E71 (display shows "E 7" — the "1" does not fit; blinks 250ms on/off, non-blocking) |

RTM exit shows `St` via `displayDigits(LET_S, LET_T)` (large-font, 2s). FM combo confirmations use `displayDigits(LET_F, mode)` for F0–F6; armed LEFT/RIGHT selection uses the same digits but leaves them visible until release or the next 2-second step. `showFullScreenMessage()` remains in use for `E 7` (water ingress). FreeRTOS vibration task continues running during any blocking display hold.

## R5 Proximity Bar (P9 New)
Row R5 (`displayBuffer[6]`) is used as a proximity bar during RTM or FM.
Blink pattern: 1000 ms on / 500 ms off.

**RTM bar (square-root curve):**
- At RTM engage: `rtm_arm_dist_m` is captured from current `telemetry.rtm_distance`.
- Each update: `pixels = round(sqrt(current_m / arm_m) × 10)`, clamped 0–10.
- Bar fills C0→C9 (left to right). Shrinks from right as buggy approaches.
- At 100% distance (just armed): all 10 pixels lit.
- At 25% distance: 5 pixels lit (sqrt(0.25) = 0.5 × 10 = 5).
- At 0% (hard stop): 0 pixels — bar gone just before RTM disengages.

![RTM Proximity Bar Animation](rtm_bar_animation.gif)

**FM bar (Priority 10 — center-expanding from C4+C5):**
- 2 pixels at C4+C5 = ideal following distance (sweet spot). Bar expands outward symmetrically as buggy gets closer. Dark when ≥30 m away. Full bar (C0-C9) = buggy right next to user.
- Implemented 2026-04-30 in `Display.ino:updateR5ProximityBar()` — replaced an earlier left-to-right linear fill. Center-expanding is the current and only implementation.

![FM Proximity Bar Animation](fm_bar_animation.gif)

**`rtm_arm_dist_m` variable:**
- RAM only — never written to SPIFFS.
- Captured at RTM engage (both single-squeeze and double-squeeze paths).
- Reset to `0.0f` inside `rtmDisengage()` on every exit path.
- If `0.0f` at bar render time, bar is suppressed (avoids divide-by-zero).

## Status / Mode Codes (TX dot display)
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| rn | RTM armed — blinks during arm window; static 2s after arm confirmed |
| St | RTM disengaged or pre-arm rejected — large-font `displayDigits(LET_S, LET_T)`, 2s |
| F0 / F1 / F2 / F3 / F4 / F5 / F6 | FM mode confirmed; armed hold selection remains visible until release/next step |
| -- | ET error or no-data — auto-clears after 3s |

## Error Codes (TX dot display)
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| EP | Not paired |
| EC | Not calibrated |
| E- | Error (code too large for display) |
| E71 | Water ingress detected (triggers 5 long buzzes) |
| E5V | Config version mismatch — re-flash or clear SPIFFS |
| U5b | USB serial mode active |
| XX | Power saver mode — remote going to sleep |

## New SPIFFS Fields — V2.5-Evo P8 (TX-side)
| Field | Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rtm_display_mode` | 0-2 | 0 | RTM/FM active display: 0=distance, 1=speed, 2=alternating 2.5s |
| `fm_warn_distance_m` | 50-164m | 150 | Fresh TX-RX distance at/above which one medium pulse fires immediately and every 2s while FM is armed |
| `rtm_steer_exit_on_input` | 0-1 | 1 | 1=steering exits RTM; 0=blend/correction mode |
| `rtm_max_runtime_s` | 0-300s | 0 | Max RTM runtime; 0=disabled (safety gates handle scenarios) |

## New SPIFFS Fields — V2.5-Evo P9 (TX-side)
| Field | Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dist_unit` | 0-1 | 0 | Distance display unit: 0=Metres/km, 1=Feet/miles. Internal math always in metres. |

**No sizeof change:** `dist_unit` fills the 2-byte tail padding left by P8.1. sizeof(confStruct) stays 128. No SPIFFS reset on first P9 flash — old configs read 0 here (tail padding was zero), which is the correct Metres default.
