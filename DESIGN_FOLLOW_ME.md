# DESIGN_FOLLOW_ME — FM Autonomous Following (Priority 9)

**Project:** BREmote V2.5-Evo
**Date:** July 18, 2026
**Status:** Implemented; F4 In Front remains experimental and requires controlled validation.
**Sibling doc:** `DESIGN_RETURN_TO_ME.md` (RTM — implemented, field-tested). FM reuses RTM's validation phases, safety gates, and steering pipeline.

## 1. Purpose and Safety Philosophy

After the whip, the rider releases the rope and rides the wave; the buggy is unmanned on its last heading. FM makes the buggy trail the rider at a configured offset and distance, steering itself, while the rider keeps eyes on the wave.

Non-negotiable (identical to RTM, overrides everything below):
1. The buggy ONLY moves while the rider physically holds the throttle trigger.
2. Autonomous systems ONLY steer and SUBTRACT throttle — never add.
3. Release throttle = buggy stops immediately, always.
4. Every failure path (GPS, compass, LoRa, geometry) drives motor → 0.

FM = autonomous steering + distance-based throttle limiting, under a human throttle hand.

## 2. Canonical mode mapping (single source of truth)

| Mode | Meaning | Geometry |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Off | — |
| 1 | **Near-Right** | behind-right diagonal at `near_diag_offset_deg` |
| 2 | **Behind** (default) | directly behind rider's course |
| 3 | **Near-Left** | behind-left diagonal |
| 4 | **In Front** | forward pacer; engagement requires the buggy already ahead |

This TX-side convention is canonical for ALL surfaces (TX display F0–F4, RX struct, both web UIs, README). Default = 2 (Behind).

## 3. What already exists (reuse verbatim — do not reimplement)

- **Mode selection plumbing:** TX gesture → 0xF2 meta-packet ×3 → RX `fm_mode_runtime` (RAM). 30 s keepalive; RTM preemption via silent disarm (0xF2/0).
- **Validation:** Phase A (RX GPS: HDOP/teleport/accel → `gps_rejected`), Phase B (TX↔RX cross-validation on 0xF3, 30 s pass / 2 s fail cadence), Phase C pattern (periodic behavioral checks).
- **Steering pipeline** (`RTMState.ino`): EMA target-position filter (τ per preset), P+D controller `kSteerPresets[5]`, heading-source ladder (GPS COG → compass snapshot → live), confidence-scaled authority, wrap-to-±180° error handling.
- **Throttle patterns:** subtract-only cap chain (`PWM.ino:47, 52–55`), approach-zone linear decel ramp, Align-phase ~5 % cap, Run-phase speed governor, engage ramp machinery.
- **Rider position:** 0xF3 GPS meta at 2 Hz (always on with TX fix) — measured sufficient: 2.0–2.4 m rider displacement per update at typical ride speed, 4.5 m at 20 mph, vs 6 m follow gap.
- **Telemetry slots:** `fm_heading_err` (idx 14) and `fm_status` (idx 15) already reserved in `TelemetryPacket`.

## 4. State machine (RX)

```
FM_IDLE → FM_ARMED → FM_ACTIVE ↔ FM_HOLD
                              ↘ FM_STOPPING → FM_IDLE
```

- **FM_IDLE:** `fm_mode_runtime` = 0 or unset. `0xFF` means no live TX declaration and never falls back to stored RX config.
- **FM_ARMED:** mode 1–4 selected; all monitoring runs; throttle chain inactive until activation conditions met. Display/telemetry reflect armed state (`fm_status`).
- **FM_ACTIVE:** engaged when ALL activation conditions hold (§5). FM steering is used while the rider's steering input is centred; throttle cap chain on (§7).
- **FM_HOLD:** a deadman or geometric condition pauses control with cap 0. Trigger release stops the motor immediately and preserves the selected mode. A short release preserves the separation proof and may resume through the engage ramp; a continuous 2 s release changes the RX to `FM_ARMED`, clears the proof and restores manual throttle for the next squeeze. Fresh positions inside effective `D_engage` below 2 km/h for 2 s independently clear the proof.
- **FM_STOPPING:** a sensor/link/heading or divergence fault ends the run, ramps the cap back to manual and requires a fresh TX declaration.
- **Mutual exclusion with RTM:** unchanged (RTM arming silently disarms FM).

While FM is ACTIVE, a manual steering deflection of at least 40 raw counts from centre takes steering
priority immediately at the 100 Hz PWM layer. FM remains ACTIVE, its separation proof and throttle
cap remain in force, and centring the input returns steering to FM. Divergence timing is parked while
manual steering has priority because the resulting path is rider-commanded, not FM convergence.
F4's independent physical front-corridor loss remains a safety HOLD and clears its front proof.

## 5. Activation / hold conditions (ALL required while FM_ACTIVE, checked every loop)

1. Throttle held: `thr_received ≥ 25` (absolute rule; motor is already 0 without it).
2. Phase A pass (RX GPS not rejected).
3. Phase B pass (TX↔RX cross-validation current).
4. TX GPS age < `tx_gps_stale_timeout_ms`.
5. RX GPS age < 6000 ms.
6. Valid heading source (per heading ladder; `rtm_compass_required` honored).
7. LoRa healthy: `millis() − last_packet < failsafe_time`.
8. Rider beyond engage distance: `dist > min_dist_m + followme_smoothing_band_m` to activate; deactivate (cap 0) only when `dist < min_dist_m` (Schmitt hysteresis — no flapping at the band edge).
9. Rider moving: rider speed ≥ `foiler_low_speed_kmh`. Below it (rider down, idle, pumping slowly) → cap 0, hold FM_ARMED. Prevents maneuvering around a swimmer.

Failure of 1 → immediate deadman HOLD with cap 0 and no TX disarm. If the release remains continuous
for 2 s, RX changes to manual `FM_ARMED` and clears the separation proof. Failures 2–7 are genuine
faults and end the FM run through STOPPING. Conditions 8–9 are geometric holds, not faults.

## 6. Target-point computation (the new control code)

Per control tick (10 Hz), all on RX:

1. **Filter:** EMA the raw 0xF3 rider position with the active preset's τ (same code path RTM uses).
2. **Rider course + speed:** derived from successive filtered positions. Valid only while rider speed ≥ ~5 km/h (measured: course noise doubles below ~3 mph). Invalid course → degraded mode: offset direction = bearing(rider → buggy) ("hold station at distance"), no diagonal.
3. **Lag anchor:** a first-order EMA trails a moving target by v·τ (13–18 m at 15–20 mph with τ = 2 s — larger than the follow gap and speed-dependent). Correct it: `anchor = filtered_pos + û_course · min(v_rider · τ_active, 2 · d_follow)`. This makes geometry speed-independent without touching the proven smoothing (deliberately NOT solved by shrinking τ: the filter must keep ignoring carves — measured p95 turn rate 49°/s at ~5 m radius; the buggy follows the low-passed path, never mirrors bottom turns).
4. **Trailing point:** `target = anchor − d_follow · R(offset) · û_course`, where `d_follow = min_dist_m + followme_smoothing_band_m` and offset = 0° (mode 2), −`near_diag_offset_deg` (mode 1, rider's right), +`near_diag_offset_deg` (mode 3). Sign convention MUST be fixed against the code's bearing convention and verified in `Tools/FollowMe Settings Visualizer.html` before water.
5. **Steer:** feed `target` to the existing steering pipeline unchanged. Publish `fm_heading_err` and `fm_status` each rotation.
6. **Side-zone hysteresis:** when the angle between rider course and rider→buggy bearing crosses `zone_angle_enter_deg`/`zone_angle_exit_deg`, blend diagonal ↔ pure-behind (Schmitt pair) so an unstable rider course cannot whip the target point across the wake.

Mode 4 replaces the trailing point with a forward station at `d_follow`. Its steering point is a
derived lookahead that is always kept ahead of the buggy, so excess lead can only be corrected by
slowing down and never by a U-turn toward the rider. Engagement uses the signed along-course lead:
`along_track > fm_engage_dist_m` inside the front-cone threshold for the existing 2 s dwell. Loss of
course, lead or front cone clears the latch and holds the motor at zero; no autonomous overtake or
automatic path across the rider exists.

## 7. Throttle cap chain (subtract-only; lowest cap wins)

| # | Cap | Source pattern |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hard stop: `dist < min_dist_m` → 0 (re-engage per §5.8 hysteresis) | RTM gate-9 distance check |
| 2 | Approach ramp: F1–F3 linear 255→0 across the smoothing band; F4 omits it because slowing when caught collapses the front gap | RTM approach pattern |
| 3 | Speed governor: F1–F3 target rider speed + margin; F4 varies around rider speed from along-track error; non-zero `boogie_vmax_in_followme_kmh` is the final absolute ceiling, while 0 means no absolute ceiling | Run-phase governor |
| 4 | Align phase: heading error > threshold → ~5 % cap | Align-phase pattern |
| 5 | Engage ramp: 0→cap over 3–4 s on every FM_ACTIVE entry | RTM ramp machinery |

FM writes caps only. The human trigger remains the sole throttle source; trigger release stops the
buggy through the unchanged base architecture without disarming the TX mode. A continuous 2 s
release also returns RX to manual `FM_ARMED` and clears the separation proof. After FM has seen its
first throttle input, the TX keeps its mode declaration alive until explicit F0/gesture disarm, RTM
preemption, an RX-reported fault or declaration loss. The separation proof also resets automatically
after 2 s below 2 km/h while radial distance is inside effective `D_engage`; explicit disarm remains
the deterministic session boundary before a new tow.

## 8. Parameters — zero new confStruct fields for F4

F4 reuses the existing FM parameters (no SW_VERSION bump):

| Param | v1 role | Owner default |
|---|---|---|
| `followme_mode` | TX starting mode / RX stored preference; live arming still requires 0xF2 | 2 (Behind) |
| `min_dist_m` | hard-stop distance | 10 m |
| `followme_smoothing_band_m` | hysteresis + ramp band (station = sum) | 10 m |
| `near_diag_offset_deg` | diagonal offset (modes 1/3) | 45° |
| `boogie_vmax_in_followme_kmh` | FM absolute speed ceiling; 0 = no absolute ceiling (F4 gap governor remains active) | 25 km/h (~15.5 mph) |
| `foiler_low_speed_kmh` | rider-down gate | 8 km/h (~5 mph) |
| `zone_angle_enter_deg` / `zone_angle_exit_deg` | side-zone Schmitt pair | 35° / 45° |
| `fm_engage_dist_m` | separation/front-proof distance; 0 = auto, otherwise 8–50 m; same effective threshold resets a set latch after 2 s below 2 km/h inside it | 0 (auto) |

Field-retunable to 4/10/20 m equivalents without reflash. At the next SW_VERSION bump (whenever one happens for other reasons), bake the proven values into `defaultConf` on both sides — a version bump resets stored config to `defaultConf` (verified against `ConfigService`/`SPIFFSEngine`; web-UI-only tuning does not survive bumps).

Deferred to a future bump (one field, shared with RTM): an RX-side autonomous-runtime cap. Neither RTM nor FM has one today (TX `rtm_max_runtime_s` defaults to 0 = disabled).

## 9. Failure modes and recovery

| Failure | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| TX (rider) GPS loss | age > `tx_gps_stale_timeout_ms` | cap 0, STOPPING → IDLE, re-arm required |
| RX GPS loss | age > 6 s | same |
| Heading source invalid | ladder empty | same |
| LoRa loss | > `failsafe_time` | PWM pulses stop immediately; FM fault/disarm when control resumes |
| Rider inside stop radius | dist < `min_dist_m` | cap 0 until beyond band |
| Rider down/slow | speed < `foiler_low_speed_kmh` | cap 0, wait |
| Rider course invalid | speed < ~5 km/h | F1–F3 degrade to hold-station; F4 stops in HOLD and clears its front proof |
| F4 no longer provably ahead/in front cone | signed lead / angle Schmitt fails | cap 0, HOLD, clear latch; fresh front proof required |
| RTM armed | 0xF2/0 silent disarm | FM off (existing) |
| Trigger released | physical | motor stops immediately; a short release stays in HOLD with proof preserved, while 2 s continuously released returns RX to manual ARMED and clears the proof |
| Rider stationary inside effective `D_engage` | radial distance < `D_engage` and filtered speed < 2 km/h for 2 s | clear latch; mode remains declared; fresh separation proof required |
| Manual steering deflected ≥40 counts | raw RX steering input | rider steering wins; FM state/latch/cap preserved; centre to return |

**Field-validation prerequisite:** FM and F4 use the same guarded heading ladder as RTM. Verify GPS COG, compass orientation and steering direction on the actual hardware, wheels up and then at controlled low speed, before any open-water use.

## 10. Test plan

1. **Bench, motor off:** mode plumbing end-to-end; simulated coordinates through the target-point math; sign/offset verification against the Settings Visualizer; hysteresis boundaries; stationary-near latch reset requires fresh positions plus both thresholds continuously for 2 s; every §5 condition force-failed → cap 0.
2. **Bench, wheels up:** cap chain order; engage ramp; align-phase cap; compass-under-load table (from Phase 0.5).
3. **Controlled water, tethered:** mode 2 (Behind) only, walking-pace rider, hard-stop verification, GPS-denial stop.
4. **Field, incremental:** mode 2 first at 6 m; then mode 1 (Near-Right); throttle hand ready to cut throughout; logging enabled (aux button) every run.

## 11. Implementation order

1. Phase 0.5 heading-feedback triage (blocking).
2. RX: FM state machine + activation conditions (§4–5).
3. RX: target-point computation (§6) feeding the existing steering pipeline.
4. RX: throttle cap chain (§7) from existing patterns.
5. Both web UIs + RX comments: canonical mapping + param descriptions (§2, §8); README table.
6. Telemetry: populate idx 14/15; TX display FM-active state.
7. Safety audit (motor-safety verdict first), then §10 gates in order.

F4 only extends TX mode selection and the existing 0xF2 value range. No new packet, config field or rate change (2 Hz 0xF3 remains unchanged).
